 * @brief Functions to read various input sensors on the device
 *
 * This file defines the sensor service, which provides functions for reading
 * the various input sensors that are available on the device, including the
 * accelerometer, magnetometer, temperature, illuminance, and so on.
 *
 * The sensors are listed by the enumeration @c #sensor_type_t.  To see if a
 * sensor is supported on the device call @c sensor_is_supported().  To start
 * receiving sensor events, call @c sensor_request_events() and pass in the
 * sensor type. To set the refresh rate of the sensor, call the @c
 * sensor_set_rate() function. To specify whether duplicate sensor events should
 * be skipped, call the @c sensor_set_skip_duplicates() function.
 *
 * Once a BPS event is received, you can call the @c sensor_get_domain()
 * function to determine whether it was a sensor event and the @c
 * bps_event_get_code() to determine the type of sensor event.
 *
 * The sensors return a variety of different data, so depending on which sensor
 * you want to use, you need to call a different @c sensor_event_get_* function
 * to retrieve the readings. See the individual functions to determine which
 * sensors they work with.
 *
 * To stop receiving sensor events, call the @c sensor_stop_events() function.
