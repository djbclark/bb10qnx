 * that may dictate the formatting of dates and numbers (e.g., time, units of
 * measurement, currency, etc.) as well as the formatting of other output that
 * may vary from region to region.
 *
 * Region settings may only be retrieved with these functions - the settings
 * cannot be changed using these functions.
