 * @brief Functions to interact with libscreen events
 * 
 * This file defines a partial wrapping of the Screen API (libscreen) to allow
 * its events and input model to work with BlackBerry Platform Services.
 *
 * This wrapping does not abstract libscreen events, but instead it directs them
 * through the BPS event dispatching mechanism. Once a libscreen event is
 * received through BPS, you must use libscreen functions to manipulate it.
 *
 * Consult the @ref bps_event_sec section for information about handling events
 * in BPS, and the Screen API documentation for details about libscreen events.
