/**
 * @brief Register a button to a forwarding action
 *        
 * The @c mediaplayer_register_button() function registers a button to forward a
 * @c #MEDIAPLAYER_BUTTON event to the application.  A button event will arrive
 * when the user releases the button, i.e., on button up.
 *
 * There are various combinations of button events that you can register for:
 * 
 * - a press of a single button
 * - a pair of buttons pressed simultaneously
 * - short or medium button presses, or both
 * - a button event on button down instead of button up
 *
 * To receive both short and medium button events for the same button or pair of
 * buttons, you will need to call this function twice, one for each button
 * length.
 *
 * To receive the button event on button down, you must register for both short
 * and medium button lengths.  When registering the short button length, set the
 * @c immediate parameter to @c true.  You will receive a button event with a
 * short button length as soon as the button is pressed down.  Even thought you
 * will not receive medium button length events, you must register for them to
 * get immediate button down events.
 *
 * @param button1 The first button. This must be one of the values of the @c
 *                #media_button_t enumeration. This value cannot be @c
 *                #MEDIA_BUTTON_NONE.
 * @param button2 The optional second button. This must be one of the values of
 *                the @c #media_button_t enumeration. If the value is not @c
 *                #MEDIA_BUTTON_NONE, the function registers the action to be
 *                taken when the user presses @c button1 and @c button2
 *                simultaneously.
 * @param length The length of the button press. Use one of the values of the @c
 *               #media_button_length_t enumeration.
 * @param immediate This flag is effective only when registering a short button
 *                  press.  This flag only affects behaviour when both a short
 *                  button press and a medium button press are registered for
 *                  the same button or pair of buttons.  If this parameter is
 *                  set to @c false when registering a short button press, then
 *                  either a short button press or a medium button press will be
 *                  reported.  If this parameter is set to @c true when
 *                  registering a short button press, then only a short button
 *                  press will be reported, but it will be reported immediately
 *                  when the button is pressed down, and not on button up.  You
 *                  must also register the medium button press to get this
 *                  behaviour.
 * @param id When this is not a @c NULL value, the ID used in the button request
 *           is returned when the function completes. The caller must free this
 *           buffer using the @c bps_free() function. The same ID is also
 *           delivered in the corresponding @c #MEDIAPLAYER_BUTTON_RESULT event.
 *
