 *
 * @brief Functions and structures to allow users to purchase digital goods in
 * applications using the BlackBerry Platform Services (BPS) Payment Service API
 *
 * The Payment Service API permits BlackBerry device users to initiate the
 * purchase of digital goods from within your application. Digital goods
 * available for purchase must be registered on the Vendor Portal for BlackBerry
 * World. For example, you can use the API to allow users to purchase additional
 * levels in a gaming application or music from a radio application.
 *
 * Purchases are initiated using the @c
 * paymentservice_purchase_request_with_arguments() function. The amount of time
 * that elapses before a response is returned depends on how quickly the user
 * completes the purchase process. The purchase process may include steps such
 * as signing in to their BlackBerry ID account, setting up their preferred
 * billing method, and so on. The Payment Service dispatches a @c
 * PURCHASE_RESPONSE event on purchase completion. The event contains a response
 * code that can be used to determine whether the purchase request was
 * successful or not.
 *
 * When calling the purchase function, you must provide either the ID or SKU of
 * the digital good to be purchased. It is not a requirement to provide both the
 * ID and SKU, and all other arguments are optional. When both the ID and SKU
 * are provided, the ID takes precedence. The SKU is only used when the digital
 * good cannot be located on the Payment Service server based on the ID.
 *
 * If an application requires a list of its digital goods that have already been
 * purchased by the user (for example, to avoid offering for sale a digital good
 * that the user already owns), this list can be obtained with the @c
 * paymentservice_get_existing_purchases_request() function. This function
 * requires the same user interaction as the purchase function, so it can also
 * be a long-running method. Upon completion of the request, the Payment Service
 * dispatches a @c GET_EXISTING_PURCHASES_RESPONSE event, which contains the
 * success/failure response code.
 *
 * The strings that are passed as input to the request functions and the strings
 * returned by the getter functions are ASCII-encoded by default.  When UTF-8
 * encoding is required, it is the responsibility of the application to convert
 * the UTF-8 encoded string to @c char* format. Conversely, it is your
 * responsibility to convert a returned @c char* format to a UTF-8 encoded
 * values as required.
 *

/**
 * @brief Initiate the purchase of a digital good
 *
 * The @c paymentservice_purchase_request() function initiates the purchase of a
 * digital good.
 *
 * It is not a requirement to provide both the ID and SKU, and all other
 * arguments are optional. The ID takes precedence when your application
 * provides both the ID and SKU. The SKU is only used only when the digital good
 * cannot be located on the Payment Service server based on the ID.
 *
 * You should provide the name of the digital good when a single ID or SKU
 * represents multiple digital goods on the Payment Service server and when a
 * more specific digital good name is required for display on the purchase
 * screen. For example, if a game sells additional levels using the Payment
 * Service at a single price point, then a generic "My game level" digital good
 * can be used for all such levels. However, at the time of purchase, the game
 * application can override "My game level" with the name of the level that was
 * purchased. This mechanism is useful to notify the end user of what is being
 * purchased on the purchase confirmation screen.
 *
 * Metadata offers the application developer a way to store information about
 * each purchase on the Payment Service server and to retrieve that data using
 * the @c paymentservice_get_existing_purchases_request() function. For example,
 * assume a book vendor offers several titles at a single price point, and
 * represents them on the Vendor Portal as a single digital good. In this case,
 * the ISBN of the book can be provided as metadata. The metadata can be used to
 * uniquely identify the digital good that was purchased. You can also retrieve
 * the entire list of purchased books at any time by using the @c
 * paymentservice_get_existing_purchases_request() function to obtain previous
 * purchases, filtering on the book's digital good Content ID, and finally,
 * enumerating the ISBNs in the metadata of each purchase.
 *
 * To further give context to the end user during an in-application purchase, a
 * banner is displayed along the top of the purchase and BlackBerry ID login
 * screens. The banner shows the name and icon of the application that the
 * purchase is being made from.
 *
 * To customize the name and icon that are displayed, simply provide them as
 * arguments. When the name or icon are not provided as arguments, then they are
 * retrieved from the purchasing application's bar-descriptor.xml file - though
 * this may not work for applications that register with the home screen
 * dynamically. In these cases, it is highly recommended that the purchasing
 * application explicitly provides a name and icon as part of the purchase
 * arguments.

 * There may be output parameters present, in the form of key/value pairs, in
 * the @c PURCHASE_RESPONSE. The number of output parameters, if any, can be
 * retrieved via @c paymentservice_event_get_extra_parameter_count(), and the
 * parameters themselves can be retrieved via @c
 * paymentservice_event_get_extra_parameter_key_at_index()
 * and @c paymentservice_event_get_extra_parameter_value_at_index().
 *
 * @param digital_good_id The ID of the digital good to purchase. Use a @c NULL
 *                        value if @c digital_good_sku should be used to
 *                        reference the digital good on the server.
 * @param digital_good_sku The SKU of the digital good to purchase. Use a @c
 *                         NULL value if the @c digital_good_id should be used
 *                         to reference the digital good on the server.
 * @param digital_good_name (Optional) The name of the digital good to
 *                          purchase. Use a @c NULL to omit this argument.
 * @param metadata (Optional) The metadata for the digital good. Use a @c NULL
 *                 value to omit this argument.
 * @param app_name (Optional) The name of the application through which the
 *                 purchase is being made, or a @c NULL value to omit this
 *                 argument. If provided, this name will be displayed in a
 *                 banner along the top of the purchase confirmation screen that
 *                 shall be presented to the user.
 * @param app_icon (Optional) The full URL to an icon to display, or a @c NULL
 *                 value to omit this argument. If provided, the icon shall be
 *                 displayed on the purchase confirmation screen that shall be
