 * @brief Functions and structures for BlackBerry Platform Services (BPS) events
 *
 * BPS events are generic structures that encapsulate
 * various types of data.  The event structure and event delivery mechanism
 * provide a way for the system to communicate with the application in an
 * asynchronous manner.
 *
 * The purpose of having a common event type across multiple services is to
 * facilitate the uniform handling of heterogenous input to your application.
 *
 * This file defines a generic event type, @c bps_event_t, that can be used by a
 * BlackBerry Platform Service to communicate with an application.  An
 * application may also use @c bps_event_t events for its own purposes.
 *
 * See bps.h for information on how to retrieve events.
