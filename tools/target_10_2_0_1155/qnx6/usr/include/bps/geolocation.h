 *
 * @brief Functions to determine the current geolocation of the device
 * 
 * This file defines the geolocation service, which provides functions for
 * reading the device's geolocation.  To read the geolocation data, the
 * application must have the @c read_geolocation capability. To grant an
 * application the @c read_geolocation capability, the bar-descriptor.xml file
 * in the application's project must contain the line
 * "<permission>read_geolocation</permission>".
 *
 * Some of these geolocation functions are designed to return boolean values
 * that indicate whether their associated attributes are valid. For example, @c
 * geolocation_event_is_altitude_valid() indicates whether the altitude from a
 * @c GEOLOCATION_INFO event is valid.
 *
 * In this context, a valid attribute means that the value of the attribute was
 * included in the last update from the geolocation system. For example, if the
 * device cannot obtain a GPS fix, but has Wi-Fi connectivity, the geolocation
 * system reports latitude, longitude, and accuracy. The system doesn't provide
 * values for any other attributes (such as altitude, heading, and so on), and
 * these attributes are marked as not valid.  This means that the validity
 * functions for these attributes return @c false.
 * 
 * Subsequently, if the device obtains a GPS fix, the geolocation system reports
 * values for all attributes, and all attributes are marked as valid. This means
 * that the validity functions for these attributes return @c true. If the GPS
 * fix is lost, the attributes other than latitude, longitude, and accuracy are
 * marked as not valid again.
 *
