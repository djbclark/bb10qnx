 *
 * @brief Functions to control the virtual keyboard
 *
 * This file defines the virtual keyboard service, which controls the on-screen
 * virtual keyboard.  The virtual keyboard service allows an application to show
 * and hide the on-screen keyboard, and receive notifications when the keyboard
 * is displayed or hidden.  Using the virtual keyboard service you can configure
 * various keyboard options.  You can also obtain the dynamic keyboard height.
 *
 * Your app can display the virtual keyboard by calling @c
 * virtualkeyboard_show(). When the device is connected to a keyboard (e.g.,
 * via Bluetooth), the virtual keyboard will not be shown unless the user
 * swipes up with two fingers from the bottom bezel.
 *
 * Your app can hide the virtual keyboard by calling @c virtualkeyboard_hide().
 *
 * To change the keyboard options, call the @c virtualkeyboard_change_options()
 * function and specify the keyboard layout and Enter key text. The enumeration
 * @c #virtualkeyboard_layout_t lists the keyboard layouts, and the enumeration
 * @c #virtualkeyboard_enter_t lists the options for Enter key text. The Enter
 * key text is automatically updated to the correct language if you change the
 * language of the keyboard.
 *
 * Key press events come through the Screen API. For more information, see the
 * Screen API or bps/screen.h.
 *
 * @since BlackBerry 10.0.0
