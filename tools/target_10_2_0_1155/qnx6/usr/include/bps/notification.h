 *
 * @brief Functions to control the notification system on the device
 *
 * An application can send requests for the following primary types of
 * notification:
 *    - a @e notify (using the @c notification_notify() function)
 *    - an @e alert (using the @c notification_alert() function)
 *
 * Both @e notify and @e alert may contain several data members that affect the
 * characteristics of the notification, defined in the @c
 * #notification_message_t structure. At a minimum, the @c
 * #notification_message_t structure must include @c item_id, which identifies
 * the notification message. The additional arguments used are:
 *     - @c title
 *     - @c subtitle
 *     - @c request_id
 *     - @c prompt_choices (@e alert only)
 *     - @c sound_url (@e notify only)
 *     - @c invocation_target (@e notify only)
 *     - @c invocation_payload (@e notify only)
 *     - @c invocation_payload_uri (@e notify only)
 *     - @c invocation_type (@e notify only)
 *     - @c invocation_action (@e notify only)
 *
 * These arguments, including @c item_id, are defined in greater
 * detail in their respective @c notification_message_set_*() functions. If a
 * member isn't given a value, a default value is assigned. As indicated in
 * the above list, some members are specific to either @e notify or @e alert
 * notifications. Furthermore, some functions, such as @c notification_cancel(),
 * require only certain members from the @c #notification_message_t structure.
 * In these instances, you can still provide any additional members, but these
 * are simply ignored if not used by a function. See individual @c
 * notification_message_set_*() functions for details regarding the
 * corresponding member's valid implementations.
 *
 * Both @e notify and @e alert can have lingering effects, such as the display
 * of a badge on an application icon or the activation of an LED. These may be
 * dealt with by the @c notification_cancel() or the @c notification_delete()
 * functions. We recommend that you call the @c notification_cancel() function
 * when your application launches, to remove any continuing notification
 * signals.
 *
 * There are settings that define the behavior of notification messages.
 * Examples of basic settings that apply to notification messages include:
 *    - Sound alert: Whether to play a sound for this application
 *    - SoundUrl: Defines a default sound
 *    - LED: Whether an LED light is activated by the notification caller
 *    - Badge: Whether the notification should display badges on icons by
 *          default. This is most commonly represented as a red symbol on the
 *          corner of the application icon.
 *    - UIB: Whether items should be added to the Notifications account in the
 *           BlackBerry Hub. Invocation parameters define what happens when a
 *           user clicks the item in the Hub.
 *    - Display: Whether a dialog notification will occur. This doesn't affect
 *          @e alert messages.
 *
 * For @e notify messages, settings define the means by which the message is
 * displayed and the volume of information displayed in the message. These
 * settings determine whether a message displays large amounts of information,
 * displays smaller amounts, or does't display any information at all. We
 * recommend that you fill out as much information as possible.
 *
 * Third party applications can't control the notification settings they
 * receive. The default notification settings allow applications to put
 * notifications into the Notifications account of the Hub. A notification will
 * be placed into the Hub if and only if the notification includes a title
 * and/or a subtitle. Your application can create a badge-only notification by
 * sending a notify message that doesn't contain a title or a subtitle.
 *
 * @e Alert messages are also affected by settings, but give more control to the
 * application that sends them. Display methods may be determined by the
 * information provided in the message. For example, by providing a title and
 * adding prompt choices (through the @c
 * notification_message_add_prompt_choice() function), you can guarantee that a
 * dialog will be displayed, which can communicate a user's response back to the
 * application.
 *
 * Settings are defined per application. There's one set of default settings
 * for all notifications from an application.
 *
 * @since BlackBerry 10.0.0
 *
 * @cond internal
 *
 * An application may define additional notification types. Reference these
 * types in the @c type member of a @e notify or @e alert message with the @c
 * notification_message_set_type() function. No third party application will be
 * able to set its own notification type.

 * but includes the following members:
 *     - Request ID (@c char* @c request_id)
 *     - Item ID (@c char* @c item_id)
 *     - Title (@c char* @c title)
 *     - Subtitle (@c char* @c subtitle)

 *     - Invocation action (@c char* @c action)
 *     - Prompt Choices (@c dialog_prompt_t* @c prompt_choices)
 *
 * To use this type:
 *     1. Instantiate a @c #notification_message_t structure with the @c

 *        functions.
 *     3. Send the desired message with the @c notification_alert() or @c
 *        notification_notify() functions.
 *     4. Remove lingering side effects from notifications with the @c
 *        notification_cancel() or @c notification_delete() functions.
 *     5. Deallocate the memory reserved for the @c #notification_message_t
 *        structure with the @c notification_message_destroy() function.
