 *
 * @brief Functions to enable Screen Input Guard
 *
 * Screen Input Guard is a feature of the device whereby the screen turns off
 * and the touchscreen is disabled during a phone call or similar voice chat.
 * This ensures that the caller's face or ear do not trigger unwanted touches on
 * the device causing unintended events.
 *
 * Screen Input Guard turns off the screen and disables the touchscreen when
 * something (assumed to be a face) is detected near the screen.  When the user
 * takes the device away from their face, Screen Input Guard turns on the screen
 * and enables the touchscreen.  However, Screen Input Guard does not turn off
 * the screen and disable the touchscreen if the device is face up, e.g. lying
 * on a table.
 *
 * For best results, call @c screen_input_guard_request_events() at least 200
 * milliseconds before you need to enable Screen Input Guard.  This amount of
 * time allows the face detection sensors to stabilize and give more accurate
 * readings.  Once you actually need the screen to turn off and the touchscreen
 * to be disabled when a face is detected, call @c screen_input_guard_enable().
 * You can also call @c screen_input_guard_request_events() and @c
 * screen_input_guard_enable() immediately after each other, without delay.
 * Note that once you call @c screen_input_guard_request_events(), extra power
 * is used, so it should not be used when not required.
 *
 * For example, call @c screen_input_guard_request_events() as soon as an
 * incoming phone call comes in.  Face detection will stabilize during the time
 * it takes for the user to answer the phone call.  If the user rejects the
 * phone call, call @c screen_input_guard_stop_events().  If the user accepts
 * the phone call, immediately call @c screen_input_guard_enable().  The screen
 * and the touchscreen will turn off when the user places the phone next to
 * their face, and the screen and the touchscreen will turn on when the device
 * is moved away from their face.  When the phone call ends, call @c
 * screen_input_guard_disable() and @c screen_input_guard_stop_events().
 *
 * As another example, when the user starts to make an outgoing phone call, call
 * @c screen_input_guard_request_events().  Face detection will stabilize while
 * the user is dialing.  As soon as the user starts the phone call and is likely
 * to place the phone next to their face, call @c screen_input_guard_enable().
 * When the phone call ends, call @c screen_input_guard_disable() and
 * @c screen_input_guard_stop_events(). However, if you expect the user to be on
 * the dial screen for a long period of time without actually dialing, it would
 * be better for power usage to wait until the phone call is started to call @c
 * screen_input_guard_request_events() and @c screen_input_guard_enable().
 *
