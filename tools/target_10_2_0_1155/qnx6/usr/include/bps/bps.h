/**
 * @mainpage BlackBerry Platform Services Library Overview
 *
 * @section bps_intro_sec BPS Introduction
 *
 * The BlackBerry Platform Services (BPS) library provides C/C++ developers with
 * a single consistent interface to a number of different platform services:
 *
 * - Audio devices
 * - Audio mixer
 * - Battery
 * - Buttons
 * - Cellular network status
 * - Clock
 * - Device information
 * - Dialogs
 * - Events
 * - Geofencing
 * - Geolocation
 * - Holster
 * - Invocation
 * - LED
 * - Locale
 * - Media controllers
 * - Media player
 * - Menus
 * - Multimedia renderer
 * - Navigator
 * - Network status
 * - Notifications
 * - Orientation
 * - Payment services
 * - Region
 * - Removable media
 * - Screen
 * - Screen capture
 * - Screen input guard
 * - Sensors
 * - Sound player
 * - Vibration
 * - Virtual keyboard
 *
 * BPS provides a functional interface to platform services, along with an
 * event-retrieval mechanism for asynchronous notification.
 *
 * @section bps_usage_sec Requesting and Listening for Events
 * 
 * The BPS library provides a high-level view of various platform services. Each
 * client application simply makes one request to the platform services that it
 * wants to receive events for. A loop is set up to listen for the events and
 * the client application determines how to handle the event using custom
 * application logic.
 *
 * Events are then generated and processed, and the application can interact
 * with the platform service as necessary.
 *
 * @subsection bps_queue_sec Using an Event Queue
 * 
 * @code
 * 
 * // 1. Start the library
 * bps_initialize();
 *
 * // 2. Request events to flow into the event queue
 * virtualkeyboard_request_events(0);
 * orientation_request_events(0);
 * navigator_request_events(0);
 *
 * // 3. Use any service at any time
 * virtualkeyboard_show(); // Show the virtual keyboard
 *
 * // 4. Listen for events
 * for (;;) {
 *   // get an event
 *    bps_event_t *event;
 *    bps_get_event(&event, -1); // blocking
 *
 *    // handle the event
 *    handle_event(&event);
 * }
 *
 * bps_shutdown();
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section bps_event_sec Events
 *
 * Different platform services generate different events. Events are
 * differentiated by the event domain (the service that generated the event) and
 * the event code (the type of the event). In addition, events can have a
 * payload that includes any information sent along from the service when it
 * generated the event.
 *
 * You can use the @c bps_event_get_domain() function to determine the service
 * (event domain) that generated a particular event. The event code can be
 * determined with the @c bps_event_get_code() function. Normally, an event
 * handler uses the event domain and event code to determine what the event is.
 * Once the event is known, it can be handled properly. For example, individual
 * accessor functions can be used to extract the payload data appropriate to the
 * event.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * @code
 *  if (bps_event_get_domain(event) == virtualkeyboard_get_domain()) {
 *         uint16_t code = bps_event_get_code(event);
 *        if (code == VIRTUALKEYBOARD_EVENT_VISIBLE) {
 *           // Keyboard is now visible. Handle event...
 *        } else if (code == VIRTUALKEYBOARD_EVENT_HIDDEN) {
 *            // Keyboard is now hidden. Handle event...
 *        } else if (code == VIRTUALKEYBOARD_EVENT_INFO) {
 *            // Extract the keyboard height
 *            int height = virtualkeyboard_event_get_height(event)
 *            // Handle...
 *         }
 *    }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * For more details on individual events, consult the documentation for the
 * service that generates the event.
 *
 * @section bps_function_sec Service Functions
 * 
 * Many services provide functions that a client can invoke. These functions are
 * documented individually with each service. The BPS library provides simple
 * functions to invoke these service functions.
 * 
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 *    // show the keyboard
 *    virtualkeyboard_show();
 * @endcode
 *
 * 
 * @section bps_channel_sec BlackBerry Platform Services Channels
 *
 * The BlackBerry Platform Services (BPS) uses channels to receive platform
 * service events. Each BPS channel has an event queue associated with it. BPS
 * restricts ownership of a channel to the thread that created the channel
 * because access to the event queue is not thread-safe. This differs from
 * channels created directly in QNX Neutrino, where a channel is owned by a
 * process and therefore, channels can be accessed by any thread owned by the
 * process.
 *
 * When you use the @c bps_initialize() function, a default channel is created
 * that is set as active. You can use the @c bps_channel_create() function to
 * create a new channel on behalf of the application. The new channel can
 * receive events once it is active. Active channels are used when you want to
 * work with events and file descriptors in your application.  You use the @c
 * bps_channel_set_active() to set a channel as active and @c
 * bps_channel_destroy() to destroy a channel you created using the
 * @c bps_channel_create() function.

 *
 * A channel is an event queue, a set of file descriptors with callbacks, and a
 * set of domain data. The channel monitors the I/O state of its file
 * descriptors and fires registered callbacks when the appropriate conditions
 * are met. Channels are tied to the thread that created them. A channel in one
 * thread cannot be used by another thread. Events can be pushed from one

 * the supplied file descriptor into the set of file descriptors that it is
 * monitoring. When the I/O conditions, specified in @c io_events, are met then
 * the channel calls the io_handler callback supplied.
 *
 * An error occurs when you add a file descriptor that was already added to the
 * channel.
 *
 * You can perform a bitwise OR to @c #bps_io_events_t enumerations and pass it
 * as a second argument to specify the I/O conditions that the channel monitors.
 *
 * For example, the code that follows shows when you want to monitor for input
 * and supply no user data:
 *
 * @code
 * bps_add_fd(fd, BPS_IO_INPUT, &io_handler, NULL);
 * @endcode
 *

 * @code
 * bps_add_fd(service->fd, BPS_IO_INPUT | BPS_IO_EXCEPT, &io_handler, &service);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The io_handler callback is called whenever @c io_events I/O conditions are
 * present for the file descriptor. The first argument will be the file
 * descriptor, the second argument will be one or more @c #bps_io_events_t
 * enumerated values to indicate which conditions are present. The third
 * argument is the user data.  If the @c io_handler callback returns
 * @c BPS_FAILURE, @c io_handler callback will no longer be called to handle the
 * specified condtions.
 *
 * @param fd The file descriptor to start monitoring.
 * @param io_events The I/O conditions to monitor for.
 * @param io_handler The I/O callback that is called whenever I/O conditions are
 *                   met.
 * @param data User supplied data that will be given to the I/O callback as the
 *             third argument.

 *
 * This function is for situations where a service doesn't have a file

 * sigevent_handler callback is to push events onto the event queue. This
 * callback has the same purpose as the @c bps_add_fd() functions's io_handler
 * callback. The difference between the io_handler and sigevent_handler
 * callbacks is that the sigevent_handler is fired whenever the channel receives
 * the sigevent that gets filled in by calling this function and the io_handler
 * gets fired when IO conditions are met for a file descriptor.
 *
 * @param sigevent An allocated sigevent that will be filled in by @c
 *                 bps_add_sigevent_handler(). A service can then use function
 *                 like @c MsgDeliverEvent to signal the callback.
 * @param sigevent_handler The sigevent callback that gets fired whenever the
 *                         channel receives the corresponding sigevent.
