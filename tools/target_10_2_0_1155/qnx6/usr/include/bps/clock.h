 * @e std @e offset_std @e dst @e offset_dst, @e rule_to, @e rule_from
 * 
 * where:
 * 
 * - @e std specifies the standard time zone (for example, EST).

 * - @e offset_std specifies the value you must add to the standard
 *   time to arrive at Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (for example, 5 or
 *   05 for Eastern Standard Time).
 * 
 * - @e dst specifies the daylight saving time zone (for example,
 *   EDT). If @e dst is omitted, then daylight saving time doesn't
 *   apply in this locale.
 * 
 * - @e offset_dst specifies the value you must add to the daylight
 *   saving time to arrive at UTC (for example, 4 or 04 for Eastern
 *   Daylight Time).
 * 
 * - @e rule_to indicates when to change to daylight saving time. The format of
 *   @e rule_to is @e Mm.n.d/time, which means day @e d (0 <= @e d <= 6) of week
 *   @e n (1 <= @e n <= 5) of month @e m (1 <= @e m <= 12) of the year.
 *   @e time indicates, in local time, when the change occurs.
 * 
 * - @e rule_from indicates when to change from daylight saving time back to
 *   standard time. The format of @e rule_from is the same as the format of
 *   @e rule_to.
 * 
 * The following is an example of this format for Eastern Standard Time:
 * 
 * EST05EDT04,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2
 * 
 * @param event The @c CLOCK_INFO event to extract the time zone change from.
 *
 * @return The time zone change.
