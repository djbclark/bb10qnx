 *
 * This file defines the multimedia renderer service, which provides functions
 * for monitoring the multimedia renderer's state. You can use the multimedia
 * renderer to play multimedia files, such as audio or video files, in your
 * applications. You can use the multimedia renderer service to monitor various
 * state properties of the multimedia renderer, such as position and buffer
 * level.
 * 
 * The multimedia renderer service allows you to monitor a specific context,
 * which represents a multimedia object that is being played.  Note that this
 * service is used only to monitor the status of a context, and provides no
 * functionality for creating or controlling contexts.
