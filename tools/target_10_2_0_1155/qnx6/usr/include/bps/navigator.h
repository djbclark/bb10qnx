/**
 * @file navigator.h
 *
 * @brief Functions for communication with the navigator
 *
 * This file contains function definitions for receiving and sending messages to
 * the navigator. The navigator controls how applications appear on the device.
 * For example, application windows can occupy the full screen, be reduced to a
 * thumbnail image while a user scrolls through active applications, or be
 * invisible to the user. All of these states are reported by the navigator
 * service. The navigator also responds to events (such as swipe events), and
 * the navigator service allows your application to respond to these events.
 *
 * You can also use the navigator service to open files that are located locally
 * on the device, as well as open URIs that you specify (including URIs that
 * correspond to applications on the device), by calling the
 * @c navigator_invoke() function. For example, you can use the navigator
 * service to launch applications such as the browser, camera, calendar, and so
 * on.
