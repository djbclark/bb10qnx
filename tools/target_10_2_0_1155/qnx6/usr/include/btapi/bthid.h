 *
 * @brief Functions to implement the Bluetooth Human Interface Device (HID) 
 *        Profile in the device role.  Can be used to remote control HID hosts
 *        such as a PC.
 *
 * This module allows an application to behave as a HID device to control a 
 * remote HID Host, such as a PC.  The HID descriptor is fixed and cannot be changed.
 * Currently 3 types of HID reports are included: mouse, keyboard and enhanced
 * keyboard controls.
 *
 * The details of the descriptor are as follows:
