 * The string pattern library provides functions to register strings containing
 * regular expressions, recognizers, and handlers which perform actions based
 * on those strings.
 *
 * Recognizers check for specific string patterns. Currently they check for
 * address, email address, phone number, PIN, SMS, and URL.
