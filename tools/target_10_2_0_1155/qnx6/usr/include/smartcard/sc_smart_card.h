 * Smart card header contains the main smart card functionality.
 *
 *
 * @mainpage Smart Card API Overview
 * Smart card API provides access to smart card functionality including:
 *   - Cryptographic API (e.g. encrypt, decrypt, sign).
 *   - Smart card PIN API (e.g. verify PIN, get num of remaining attempts, etc).
 *   - Smart card session management (e.g. attach/detach)
 *   - Reader functionality (e.g. listing available readers, monitoring reader state)
 *   - Ability to send custom APDUs.
 *
 *
 * Here is a sample flow for accessing smart card functionality:
 *   - Create context using sc_create_context()
 *   - Allocate a handle for accessing reader functionality using
 *         sc_allocate_handle( context, SC_HANDLE_READER_SLOT_LOGICAL, reader_name )
 *   - Obtain supported card drivers that can work with the card in the reader using
 *         sc_get_card_types_for_reader()
 *   - Chose the card driver to use and allocate card holder verifier handle using
 *         sc_allocate_handle( context, SCS_HANDLE_CARD_HOLDER_VERIFIER, chosen_card_name )
 *   - Attach to the card via reader using
 *         sc_attach_by_reader( context, reader_name, SCARD_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE )
 *   - Execute required actions on the card.
 *   - Detach using sc_detach().
 *   - Destroy context using sc_destroy_context().
