 * @file sc_data_types.h
 *
 * The files defines common smart card data types.
 * Most of the types are defined by PC/SC specification.
 *
 * PC/SC specification can be found at
 * http://www.pcscworkgroup.com/specifications/overview.php
 *
 * PC/SC spec parts 5 and 6 may of particular interest to developers.
 *
 * Acronyms that are being using in this API
 * (refer to PC/SC part 1 for more information):
 *
 *  - PC/SC - Smart card specification that is being followed in this API.
 *  - ATR -   Smart card answer to reset. A binary card type identifier.
 *  - DER -   Distinguished encoding rules. Often used for encoding cryptographic
 *            documents (e.g. certificates).
 *  - X509 -  Standard format for public key certificates.
 *  - ICC -   Integrated circuit card. A general name for smart cards.
 *  - IHV -   ICC holder verification.
 *  - CHV -   Card holder verification. Refers to a mechanism of
 *            authenticating card user to a card.
 *  - IFD -   Interface Device. A terminal, communication device, or machine
 *            to which the integrated circuit(s) card is electrically connected
 *            during operation. Essentially, IFD refers to smart card reader.
 *  - ICCSP - An ICCSP is a Service Provider that interfaces ICC functionality.
