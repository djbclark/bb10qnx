 *
 * Note that, once created, instances of this class cannot have their thread affinity changed,
 * either explicitly via @c QObject::moveToThread() or implicitly by changing the thread
 * affinity of the parent of the object. Doing so results in undefined behavior.

    /*!
     * @brief Emitted when the device detects that it is running low on memory.
     *
     * @details Any slot attached to this signal is notified when the device detects that memory
     * is running low. A device in this state may experience degraded performance
     * and possibly application crashes if the situation is not rectified.
     *
     * To avoid these problems, when this signal is received the application should release as much
     * memory as possible. For example, the application could free cached items that can be re-obtained
     * later, or release memory for images that can be re-read from the file system.
     *
     * The parameter @c level provides an indication of the severity of the memory situation on the device.
     * Values for this parameter are:
     * - @c bb::LowMemoryWarningLevel::LowPriority Memory is running low and the application should deallocate
     *   unnecessary objects, to ensure that the amount of available memory does not drop critically low.
     * - @c bb::LowMemoryWarningLevel::HighPriority Memory is running critically low. Applications should
     *   deallocate unnecessary object more aggressively.
     *
     * If memory continues to run low after a high priority warning, applications may be asked to exit. This
     * exit process is identical to the application being shut down by the user, including the opportunity to
     * clean up and save application state.
     *
     * Note that the device may skip some of these indications and steps depending on whether the memory
     * situation improves or worsens over time.
     *
     * If memory continues to run low after applications are asked to exit, then applications may be terminated
     * without warning and without any chance to perform any cleanup or save any state.
     *
     * Example usage in C++
