 * application, you should use the @c bb::cascades::Application class.

     * application without warning. If the user tries to close the application, a dialog box
     * is displayed with the title and message specified. The dialog box will have 2 buttons:
     * "Cancel" and "Close". If the user selects "Close", the application will be closed.
     * If the user selects "Cancel", the dialog box will close and the application will continue running.

     * Note that the save prompt for an application is stored persistently on the device. The last

     * close prompt that will be shown. The close prompt persists until @c unsetClosePrompt() is
     * called on any @c %ApplicationSupport or @c %Application object. Destroying the object that set
     * the close prompt does not reset the value.

     * Note that all commas and double quotes are stripped from the title and message parameters
     * before they are displayed. These characters cannot be displayed correctly. If the

     * white space characters like tabs ('\\t') and newlines ('\\n'). Since these whitespace
     * characters are allowed in the dialog box, they cannot be stripped.
     *
     * Escape characters can be used, but they may be awkward to specify. The string provided
     * to this method is in turn forwarded to the device's home screen process, which interprets
     * the string a second time, including any escape characters. This can require multiple
     * levels of escaping to produce the desired effect. For instance, to add a backslash ('\')
     * character to the close prompt, the string "\\\\" must be used. This provides the string
     * "\\" to this object. When this string is forwarded to the home screen, "\\" is interpreted

     * updates or can result in stale data appearing in the UI.
