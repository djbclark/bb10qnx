 * @brief Connects to an SQL database and executes commands asynchronously.
 *
 * The @c SqlConnection class is the public class that applications use to create a
 * connection to an SQL database and execute SQL commands asynchronously in another thread.
 *
 * Performing long operations in a separate (non-main) thread will ensure that the
 * overall application responsiveness (for example, swift response to button clicks)
 * is maintained even when database operations are being performed. Also, since
 * SQLite has limitations with the use of multiple connections, having all access
 * to an SQLite database working through a single SqlConnection object is a good
 * pattern.
 *
 * Here's an example of how to connect to an SQL database using @c %SqlConnection and handle
 * the results:
 *
 * @snippet libbbdata/examples/SqlConnection/src/SqlConnectionExamples.cpp loadsql1

 * @xmlonly
 * <qml>

     * If an error is detected when executing an SQL query for a particular value set then the

     * <h3>Transactions</h3>
     *
     * A batch operation such as this should always be performed in a transaction.
     * This will perform much better than if each individual query within the
     * batch is a separate transaction. Results show that using executeBatch with
     * large value sets and failing to use a transaction can result in performance
     * that can be 100X slower.
     *
     * If a transaction has not been started before this @c executeBatch method is
     * called then it will automatically use a transaction to ensure good
     * performance. In this case it will do the following internally:
     * - Start a new transaction
     * - Execute a query for each value set
     * - If an error occurs, rollback the transaction
     * - If no error occurs, commit the transaction
     *
     * If a transaction has already been started before this @c executeBatch method
     * is called then it is up to the calling code to manage the transaction
     * processing. A common case would be when multiple calls to execute() and/or
     * @c executeBatch() need to be combined into a single transaction to ensure
     * a consistent result. Here is a simple example (minimal error checking):
     * - sc.beginTransaction();
     * - sc.execute(query1);
     * - sc.execute(query2);
     * - sc.executeBatch(batch1, values);
     * - if sc.hasError()
     *     - sc.rollbackTransaction();
     * - else
     *     - sc.endTransaction();
     *
     * @param query The parameterized SQL command to execute.
     * @param valuesTable The list of value sets to bind to placeholders in query.
     * @param id An ID that's used to help match this request with a particular reply.
