 *
 * @brief The @c %MediaPlayer class provides the ability to control media playback.
 *
 * @details This class is used by applications to control the playback of media
 * sources. Creating multiple instances of this class allows you to play
 * multiple media sources at the same time.
 *
 * A playback example in C++:
 *
 * @code
        bb::multimedia::MediaPlayer mp(this);
        mp.setSourceUrl("asset:///media.mp3");

    On user events...

        void onPlay() {
            mp.play(); // automatically prepares
        }

        void onStop() {
            mp.stop();
        }

 * @endcode
 *
 * A playback example in QML:
 *
 * @code
    import bb.multimedia 1.0
    // ...
