 *
 *
 * @brief Provides exclusive system access to media notification areas.
 *
 * @details The @c %NowPlayingConnection class provides exclusive system access
 * to the media information area that describe the media that is currently active
 * on the device. This class also provides a means to receive media
 * control event notifications.
 *
 * A now playing example from native:
 *
 * @code
        NowPlayingConnection np("myConnection", this);
        QVariantMap metadata;

        metadata[MetaData::Title] = "Sample Track";
        metadata[MetaData::Artist] = "Sample Artist";
        metadata[MetaData::Album] = "Sample Album";

        np->setMetaData(metadata);

        np->setIconUrl(
            QUrl("file://%1/app/native/assets/artwork.png")
            .arg(QDir::currentPath()));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The service must be acquired before playing. A service that is playing will
 * automatically revoke any other connected user.
 *
 * @code
       np->acquire();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Once the @c acquired() signal is received, it is possible to send
 * the media data:
 *
 * @code
        // Represents 2min duration in milliseconds.
        np->setDuration(120000);

        // Represents the starting position.
        np->setPosition(0);

        // Notifies of the playing media state.
        np->setMediaState(bb::multimedia::MediaState::Started);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Acquired signals can be used in calls to @c next(), @c previous(),
 * @c play(), @c pause(), and @c stop(). Upon receiving a signal, the
 * user must call the function that is most appropriate for their media.
 *
 * Once a @c revoked() signal has been received, playback of the media
 * must be stopped and all media resources must be released. For example,
 * an audio recorder that receives a @c revoked() signal must give up its
 * access to the microphone, which could allow another process to use it.
 *
 * The @c controllerActive property provides notification to indicate that
 * one or more controllers are attached to the service that is currently
 * acquired. The controllers require regular status updates to function
 * accurately. This means that even if an application is in standby mode,
 * regular status messages should continue to be sent to it.
 *
 * With no @c audioManagerHandle specified, the now playing service will
 * automatically call @c play() when no longer preempted. If an
 * @c audioManagerHandle is specified, the now playing service will only call
 * @c play() if the audio routing has not changed to a more public device
 * while preempted.
 *
 * A now playing example from QML:
 *
 * @code
      import bb.multimedia 1.0
      ...
      attachedObjects: [
          NowPlayingConnection {
              id: nowplaying

              icon: "asset:///artwork.png"

              onAcquired: {
                var metadata = { "track": "MyTrack", "artist" : "MyArtist" };

                nowplaying.duration = 120000; // 2min in milliseconds
                nowplaying.position = 0;

                nowplaying.mediaState = MediaState.Started;

                nowplaying.setMetaData(metadata);
              }

              onRevoked: {
                mymedia.stop();
