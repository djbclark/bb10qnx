 *
 * @brief Provides system access to media controlling features.
 *
 * @details The @c %NowPlayingController class provides the ability to control media
 * which has been acquired using @c %NowPlayingConnection. Provides notification
 * of the current position, duration, state and meta data of the active media.
 *
 * A now playing sample in C++:
 *
 * @code
        // create controller object
        NowPlayingController *npc = new NowPlayingController(this);

        QVariantMap metadata;

        // get metadata for the currently being played track
        metadata = npc->metaData();

        // extract metadata values
        m_title = metadata[MetaData::Title];
        m_artist = metadata[MetaData::Artist];
        m_album = metadata[MetaData::Album];

        ...

        // start playing track
        npc->play();
        // set volume to 50% of maximum value
        npc->setVolume(0.5);

 * @endcode
 *
 * Controlling methods can be used to set volume (mute included), play, pause,
 * stop media playing, skip to the next or return to the previous track,
 * fast forward and rewind.
 *
 * A now playing sample in QML:
 *
 * @code
