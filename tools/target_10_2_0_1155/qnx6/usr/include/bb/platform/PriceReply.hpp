 * @brief Represents a response to @c PaymentManager::requestPrice().
 *
 * @details An instance of this class is returned when a @c PaymentManager::requestPrice() is made.  Initially, the returned object
 * will be unfinished and will not contain any valid information relating to the request (other than
 * that it is unfinished).  Once the request is finished, @c PaymentReply::isError() can be used to determine whether the request succeeded or failed.
 * If the request was successful, then the @c price() method provides the price of the digital good.
 * If the request failed, then the error code and error text are included; these can be accessed on
 * the @c PaymentReply base class.
 *
 * The @c finished() signal can be used to determine when the request finishes.  The
 * @c PaymentManager::priceFinished() signal can also be used to determine when a request finishes.
 *
 * @note Do not delete the object in a slot connected to any of the finished signals.  Use @c QObject::deleteLater()
 * instead.
