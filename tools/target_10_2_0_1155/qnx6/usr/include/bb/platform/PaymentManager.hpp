 *
 * @brief Allows applications to manage digital good purchases and subscriptions.
 *
 * @details @c PaymentManager allows BlackBerry device users to initiate the purchase of digital goods
 * from within an application. For example, this API can be used to allow users to purchase additional
 * levels in a gaming application, music from a radio application, or any other digital good registered
 * on the Vendor Portal for BlackBerry World. The digital good being purchased must be associated
 * with the calling application in the Vendor Portal for BlackBerry World.
 *
 * The application interacts with the @c PaymentManager by creating a @c PaymentManager instance and calling the appropriate
 * request method, which returns an appropriate @c PaymentReply subclass on success, or 0 on failure. When the request has been processed,
 * the @c PaymentReply::finished() signal will be emitted on the returned reply instance and the appropriate @c *Finished() signal will
 * be emitted on the @c PaymentManager instance.  Results of the request, including success/failure, can be queried from the reply instance.
 * See @c PaymentReply and subclasses for more on this.
 *
 * To give context to the end user during an in-application purchase, a banner is displayed along the top of the purchase
 * and BlackBerry ID login screens, showing the name and icon of the application the purchase is being made from
 * (that is, the purchasing application). The application name and icon can be customized by calling
 * @c setApplicationName(const QString&) and @c setApplicationIconUrl(const QUrl&).
 * If the name and icon are not provided, then they are retrieved from the purchasing application's descriptor.
 * However, this may not work for applications that register with the home screen dynamically;
 * in this case, the purchasing application should explicitly provide a name and icon.
 *
 * The amount of time that elapses before a reply finishes depends on how quickly the user completes the purchase process,
 * which may include steps such as signing in to their BlackBerry ID account, setting up their preferred billing method, etc.
 * 
 * Purchases are initiated with the @c requestPurchase() method.
 *
 * A list of already-purchased digital goods can be retrieved with the @c requestExistingPurchases() method.
 *
 * The price of a digital good or subscription can be obtained with the @c requestPrice() method. If the digital good is a subscription,
 * then the additional details pertaining to the subscription can be obtained using @c PaymentManager::requestSubscriptionTerms().
 *
 * The status and terms of subscriptions can be queried with the @c requestSubscriptionStatus and @c requestSubscriptionTerms() methods respectively.
 * Note that subscriptions remain active until the subscription period ends, even if they have been canceled.
 *
 * Subscription can be canceled with the @c requestCancelSubscription() method.
 *
 * @note After the request has finished, it is the responsibility of the user to delete the reply
 * object at an appropriate time. Do not directly delete it inside the slot connected to any of the finished signals. You can
 * use the @c QObject::deleteLater() function.
 *
 * @note The returned reply is a child of the @c PaymentManager to avoid memory leaks if the caller
 * fails to delete it manually.  The reply can be reparented if necessary (e.g., if it needs to 
 * live longer than the @c PaymentManager).

     * @brief Requests the purchase of a digital good or subscription.
     *
     * @details Only one of the ID or SKU of the digital good or subscription is required in order to request a
     * purchase.  If both are provided, then the ID takes precedence, and the SKU will only be used in case the
     * ID cannot be found. To use only the SKU, pass an empty string as the @c digitalGoodId.
     *
     * A digital good name should be provided in the case where a single ID/SKU represents multiple
     * digital goods on the Payment Service server, and a more specific digital good name should be
     * displayed on the purchase screen.
     * For example, if a game sells additional levels at a single price point,
     * then a generic "My game level" digital good can be used for all such levels. However, at purchase
     * time, the game application should override "My game level" with the name of the level being
     * purchased. This way, the end user is aware of exactly what they are purchasing on the purchase
     * confirmation screen.
     *
     * Purchase metadata offers the application developer a way to store information about each purchase on
     * the Payment server, and to retrieve that data via  @c requestExistingPurchases().
     * For example, assume a book vendor offers many titles at a single price point, and represents
     * them on the vendor portal as a single digital good. In this case, the ISBN of the book can
     * be provided as purchase metadata, which uniquely identifies the digital good that was purchased.
     * The entire list of purchased books can then be retrieved at any time by obtaining previous purchases
     * via the @c requestExistingPurchases() method, filtering on the book's digital good ID, and finally
     * enumerating the ISBNs in the purchase metadata.
     *
     * Extra parameters, in the form of key/value pairs in a @c QVariantMap, can be associated with the purchase request.
     * Any type with a valid @c QVariant::toString() can be used as a value in the map. Output parameters may be present in the
     * @c PurchaseReceipt and can be retrieved via @c PurchaseReceipt::extraParameters(). Input and output parameters may not be
     * directly related (i.e., output parameters may be present in the @c PurchaseReceipt where none were input, or vice versa).
     * Extra parameters are only relevant to the initial purchase (and would not be present, for example, in @c PurchaseReceipt objects
     * returned by @c requestExistingPurchases()).
     *
     * If the request is successfully made, a @c PurchaseReply is returned.  The returned object can
     * be used to obtain information about the request, including when the request has finished.
     * See @c PurchaseReply for more on this.
     *
     * Determining when the request has finished can be done through the @c PurchaseReply::finished() signal or the
     * @c PaymentManager::purchaseFinished() signal.
     *
