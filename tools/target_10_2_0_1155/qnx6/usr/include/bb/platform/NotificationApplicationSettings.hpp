 *
 * @brief Provides methods to read an application's persistent notification settings.
 *
 * @details The @c NotificationApplicationSettings class provides methods to read an application's
 *          notification settings. The settings themselves are set by the end user.
 *
 *          An application's notification settings are represented by a set of policies. These policies
 *          determine which effects (such as playing a sound, vibrating the device, flashing the LED, and so on) may be
 *          triggered when the Notification system wants to notify the user. Ultimately the Notification system will
 *          decide which effects actually get presented to the user based on a combination of an application's notification
 *          settings and the global notification settings.
 *
 *          The role of the notification settings are as such:
 *
 *          - SOUND   If the global setting for sound effects is set to "allow", then an application setting may
 *                    override the global setting to "deny". If the global setting is set to "deny" then the
 *                    application setting will have no effect.
 *
 *          - VIBRATE If the global setting for vibration effects is set to "allow", then an application setting may
 *                    override the global setting to "deny". If the global setting is set to "deny" then the application
 *                    setting will have no effect.
 *
 *          - LED     If the global setting for LED effects is set to "allow", then an application setting may override the
 *                    global setting to "deny". If the global setting is set to "deny" then the application setting will have
 *                    no effect.
 *
 *          - PREVIEW If the global setting for Instant Preview effects is set to "allow", then an application setting may
 *                    override the global setting to "deny". The application setting may also be set to "priority only",
 *                    in which case the Notification system will only display Instant Previews for notifications coming
 *                    from priority sources. If the application setting is set to "not applicable", then Instant Preview
 *                    effects are not applicable to the application and the user setting will be hidden in the Application
 *                    Settings UI. If the global setting is set to "deny" then the application setting will have no effect.
 *
 *          - ALERTS  If alerts are "enabled", then the settings will behave as described above. If alerts are "disabled",
 *                    then no effects will be triggered, regardless of other notification settings.
 *
 *          An application may use @c NotificationDefaultApplicationSettings to perform a one time change
 *          of its initial settings from the defaults set by the Notification system.
