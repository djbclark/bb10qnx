 *
 * @brief The @c HomeScreen class encapsulates interactions between an application and the home screen on the device.
 *
 * @details The @c HomeScreen class provides an API for interactions between an application and the home screen.
 * The current set of possible interactions are:
 * - Changing the wallpaper on the background of the home screen to a new image.
 * - Notifications when the device becomes screen or password locked.
 * - Adding shortcuts for URLs.
 * - Notification when the device enters and exits bedside mode.
 *
 * Note that, once created, objects of this class cannot have their thread affinity changed,
 * either explicitly via @c QObject::moveToThread() or implicitly by changing the thread
 * affinity of the parent of the object.  Doing so results in undefined behavior.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @include libbbplatform/Homescreen_constructor.cpp
 *
 * @xmlonly
 * <apigrouping group="Platform/Home screen"/>
 * <library name="bbplatform"/>
 * <qml>
 *    <class register="yes" />
 * </qml>
 * @endxmlonly

     * Legal path specifications are described below.
     *
     * The image will be scaled to fit the screen.
     *
     * If the wallpaper image is deleted while it is set as the current wallpaper (say, because
     * the image is an asset in an application that is then deleted), the image will remain the
     * wallpaper until the device is rebooted.  At that point, the default wallpaper will be reapplied.
     *
     * The new wallpaper is only applied to the currently active view (personal, work, etc.).
     *
     * Note that this method now operates synchronously.  The return value now indicates the results from
     * the home screen, not that the request was successfully issued.  A return value of @c true means the
     * request was successfully processed, @c false indicates an error (which we interpret as the wallpaper
     * being locked).  There is no longer any need to use the @c wallpaperFinished() signal to get the
     * results.  However, for backwards compatibility, the signal is still emitted.
     *
     * The supplied URL can be one of the following:
     * - An asset associated with the application.  The assets directory can be specified using the @c "asset:///" scheme
     *   in the URL.  The path of the URL is interpreted as a relative path using the assets directory as the base.
     *   For example, <code>QUrl("asset:///images/background.png")</code> uses an image from the assets directory.
     * - An absolute path to the file.  This can be specified using a @c "file:///" URL or simply supplying an absolute path
     *   with no scheme in the URL.  For example, <code>QUrl("file:///accounts/1000/shared/camera/background.png")</code> or
     *   <code>QUrl("/accounts/1000/shared/camera/background.png")</code> uses the image file from the shared photos directory (assuming
     *   the application has permission to access shared files).
     * - A relative path, relative to the root of the application's working directory.  To provide a relative path, do not
     *   supply a scheme in the URL.  Simply supply a relative path to the desired file. For example,
     *   <code>QUrl("app/native/assets/images/background.png")</code> uses an image from the assets directory.
     *
     * Unrecognized URL schemes will result in a failure.
     *
     * The supplied URL must refer to a file that contains a recognized image type. Recognized image files are those
     * that end in one of the following extensions: .jpg, jpeg, .jfif, .jif, .jpe, or .png.
     *
     * @warning Note that this method does not validate the contents of the supplied image, just that the extension
     * matches a recognized image file.  As a result, the return value of this method only indicates if
     * it successfully requested that the wallpaper be set to the supplied path, and not whether the wallpaper
     * was successfully changed.  If the path leads to an invalid image, this method may return true even
     * though the wallpaper is not changed.  Also note that supplying an invalid file will cause the wallpaper
     * to be reset to the system default.
