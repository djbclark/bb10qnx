 * @headerfile IdentityServiceProvider.hpp <bb/platform/identity/IdentityServiceProvider>
 * @brief Use these APIs to provide seamless user authentication/authorization with
 * off-device services.
 *
 * @brief Use the Identity Service provider class to incorporate user authentication
 * and authorization, using one or more external identity providers, in your application.
 *
 * @details Identity Service provider class
 *
 * You can use the APIs in the Identity Service provider class to enable your users to
 * access off-device services and content that require user authentication or authorization.
 * Content and services include data storage and retrieval, and access to services with an
 * external identity provider.  You can also personalize the user experience by integrating
 * users' personal information in your application.
 *
 * An application needs separate instances of the IdentityServiceProvider class for each
 * identity provider that it uses. Using the same instance of IdentityServiceProvider
 * for different providers could lead to undefined behavior.
 *
 * Your users can sign in with their identity provider, using their BlackBerry device, and
 * access content or services that they have with that identity provider from within your
 * application and elsewhere on their device.
 *
 * Any authorization that your application requires can also be done using the login
 * credentials associated with an identity provider.  This approach frees your users from
 * having to remember another login profile, and saves you from having to build user
 * authentication into your application.
 *
 * For example, if you registered your application with BlackBerry ID as your identity
 * provider, your users could access BlackBerry ID controlled resources from within your
 * application, without having to log in again.  BlackBerry ID is one of the supported
 * identity providers, and the list of identity providers is growing.
 *
 * Identity providers can offer different features and levels of access.  It's important
 * to understand the features that are available from your identity provider because
 * those features impact how you design your application.  For example, one identity
 * provider might provide off-device data storage while another might provide on-device
 * data storage.  Similarly, the personal information that you can retrieve with the
 * @c requestProperties() function differ based on the information that each identity
 * provider stores in their account system.
 *
 * You will need to use this documentation in conjunction with the information from
 * your identity provider about how they have implemented the Identity Service provider
 * APIs on thier end.  If you are using BlackBerry ID as the Identity Service provider
 * for your application, you can find information specific to integrating with
 * BlackBerry ID in the IdentityBlackBerryId header files.
 *
 * @section DataStorage_section Data storage and retrieval APIs
 *
 * You can use the APIs in the Identity Service provider class to:
 * - store data initially(createData())
 * - retrieve data (requestData())
 * - update data (setData())
 * - remove data (deleteData())
 * - list stored data (listData())
 *
 * @section UserAuth_Section User authentication without prompting for credentials
 *
 * With the user authentication APIs in this class, you can avoid implementing username
 * and password management in your application.  After your user signs in with the
 * identity provider on their device, that user is automatically signed in to your
 * application as well.  This eliminates the need for users to create and remember a
 * username and password for your application, and it also reduces the number of times
 * that users need to log in, providing a more fluid user experience.
 *
 * @section OffDeviceAuth_Section User authorization for access to off-device services
 *
 * If your application interacts with one of your identity provider's applications or
 * off-device services, and that application or service requires user authentication,
 * you can use the Identity Service provider class to perform that authentication.  User
 * authentication/authorization is done using tokens, and does not require user input.
 * This allows your application and the off-device service to interact seemlessly.
 *
 * @section PII_Section Using personal information in your application
 *
 * Users must first allow your application to access their information.  If allowed
 * access, you can integrate the personal information associated with your users' accounts
 * in your application.  The personal information that is available to your application
 * depends on what information is available from your identity provider's account
 * system.
 *
 * For example, if your application uses BlackBerry ID as an identity provider, your
 * application can access the following pieces of a user's personal information:
 * - first name
 * - last name
 * - screen name
 * - username
 *
 * Check with other identity providers to identify the personal information they make
 * available.
 *
 * @section bbid_modes_sec Registering your application to use the IdentityServiceProvider
 * class.
 *
 * To register your application so that it can use the IdentityServiceProvider class,
 * either pass the name of the provider into the constructor, or call setProvider for
 * an instance of a class.  A separate instance of IdentityServiceProvider should be
 * created for each provider that an application relies on.
