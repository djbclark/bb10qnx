 * @brief Represents a response to @c PaymentManager::requestExistingPurchases().
 *
 * @details An instance of this class is returned when a call to @c PaymentManager::requestExistingPurchases() is made.
 * Initially, the returned object will be unfinished and will not contain any valid information relating to the
 * request (other than that it is unfinished).  Once the request is finished, @c PaymentReply::isError() can be
 * used to determine whether the request succeeded or failed.
 * If the request was successful, then the @c purchases() method provides the list of receipts for all existing purchases.
 * If the request failed, then the error code and error text are included; these can be accessed on
 * the @c PaymentReply base class.
 *
 * The @c finished() signal can be used to determine when the request finishes.  The
 * @c PaymentManager::existingPurchasesFinished() signal can also be used to determine when a request finishes.
 *
 * @note Do not delete the object in a slot connected to any of the finished signals.  Use @c QObject::deleteLater()
 * instead.
