 *
 * @brief Specifies the different types of menu items.
 *
 * @c MenuItems can be grouped into two general categories: "channels" and "shortcuts".
 * "Channel" menu items represent plain invocation targets and are intended to be listed with
 * other "channel" menu items.
 *
 * "Shortcut" menu items represent invocation targets that include information to be used by the
 * target as a suggestion for pre-populating data. The suggestions are based on frecency (frequent/recent)
 * scores based on the user's device usage. By detecting that a @c MenuItem is a "shortcut", the
 * application can display the @c MenuItem in a more prominent position in the target selection menu,
 * since the @c MenuItem represents a task that the user commonly performs and is likely to want to
 * perform again. "Shortcut" menu items also include presentation information that set them apart from
 * other menu items.
 *
 * For example, if the device user frequently shares images to a specific contact using email, the
 * "Share" @c MenuItem may contain both a "channel" @c MenuItem to represent the general share-by-email
 * invocation (without a pre-selected contact), and a "shortcut" @c MenuItem to represent the
 * share-by-email to the specific contact. The "shortcut" @c MenuItem will have a the contact's
 * display name as the label, and the contact's avatar as the icon. The "shortcut" @c MenuItem can
 * be displayed prominently, and when selected will invoke the email composer which will pre-populate
 * the "To:" field with the contact's email address, instead of requiring the user to enter the
 * email address.
