 * @headerfile InvokeManager.hpp <bb/system/InvokeManager>
 *
 * @brief Manages all interactions with the invocation service.
 *
 * @details Invocation is the process by which a client process can send a message to a target 
 * process so it will perform a particular action. Invocation addresses locating a target 
 * instance (spawning one if necessary) and delivering the invocation message. Clients 
 * may explicitly specify a target (bound invocation) or allow the invocation service to 
 * find a "best fit" (unbound invocation). Clients can also request a list of available 
 * targets to perform their own selection.
 *
 * Invocation targets can be applications, cards, or services, and must declare
 * themselves as the appropriate target in their BAR manifest so that they are registered
 * as valid invocation targets.
 *
 * The @c InvokeManager supports both sending and receiving invoke messages thus allowing
 * an application to act as a client, a target, or both. Applications and cards receive invoke
 * messages by connecting to the @c invoked(const bb::system::InvokeRequest&) signal.
 * Applications and cards can determine if they were launched as the result of an invoke
 * message using the @c startupMode() method. The data from an invoke message received at
 * startup will arrive via one of the aforementioned signals.
 *
 * To send an invoke message, construct an @c InvokeRequest object and pass it to the
 * @c invoke() method. The returned @c InvokeReply object will contain the result of the
 * invoke operation when it becomes available. To discover which invocation targets are
 * available, construct an @c InvokeQueryTargetsRequest object and pass it to
 * @c queryTargets(). Similar to @c invoke(), the results are returned asynchronously via
 * an instance of @c InvokeQueryTargetsReply.
 *
 * An application target behaves like a typical application. When it is invoked through
 * the invocation framework, the context switches to the invoked application, and it
 * behaves as if it was launched from the home screen (it will appear thumbnailed on the
 * screen that shows running applications).
 *
 * A card is similar to an application, but when a card is invoked, the context does not
 * switch to a separate application. Instead, the card is transitioned into the foreground
 * of the application that invoked it, thus integrating more fluently into the flow of
 * the invoking application. Although a card executes in its own process and renders in
 * its own windows, it can still be considered part of the running application in that
 * the card cannot be minimized on its own (and will not appear separately in the list of running
 * applications on the home screen). A card is intended to provide discrete functionality such as
 * picking a contact, composing an email, or previewing an image. Cards can be "stacked",
 * but a parent (the invoking entity) can only invoke one card at a time.
 *
 * When a card has completed the activity is was invoked to perform, it informs the parent
 * using the @c sendCardDone() method, passing a @c CardDoneMessage to include any results.
 * Results from a card can include the reason the card completed,
 * any data that needs to be sent to the parent, and the data type
 * of the data. The parent will receive the @c childCardDone() signal. After the invocation
 * framework has transitioned the card off-screen, it will emit the @c cardPooled() signal
 * to the card. This indicates that the card process is still running, but has been pooled
 * so that future invocations are optimized. Therefore, when the card receives this signal,
 * it must reset its state so that it is ready to be invoked cleanly again. For example, for
 * a composer, any input should be discarded.
 *
 * A parent can close its child and any stacked cards by calling @c closeChildCard().
 * Each card will be notified with the @c cardPooled() signal, and the parent will receive
 * the @c childCardDone() signal as an acknowledgment. Similarly, the invocation
 * framework can close a stack of cards (for example, if the user navigates away from the cards);
 * if this occurs, the parent receives the @c childCardDone() signal and each card receives
 * a @c cardPooled() signal.
 *
 * Cards can also be invoked as part of a list of invocations by specifying
 * @c bb::system::InvokeRequest::setListId(). Cards that belong to lists can be navigated
 * through using system gestures and keyboard shortcuts. The currently open card of a list
 * may request to be replaced with its previous or next item via @c selectListItem().
 *
 * The application requesting a card to be opened as a list item should
 * connect to the relevant signals (@c listItemSelected(), @c listItemSelectedFromCursor(),
 * @c listCursorMoved()) and if appropriate, issue corresponding invoke requests.
 *
 * An application can have at most one invoke list active at a time.
