 *
 * @brief A dialog box that presents the user with a list of choices.
 *
 * @details The dialog box displayed will be an application-modal window, though it is possible to use a system-modal window by setting the
 * @c SystemListDialog::modality property.
 * The dialog box presents a list of choices.  By default, single selection mode is enabled, which allows a user to select a single option from the list.
 * Alternately, multiple selection mode can be enabled to allow the user to select multiple options from the list.  In both modes, the user can choose
 * to select none of the presented options.

 * In addition, the @c buttonAreaLimit property controls the number of buttons that will be contained in the button area of the window.
 * By default, the button area will be large enough to contain @c confirmButton, @c customButton, and @c cancelButton, if they are valid.
 * The buttons will be considered invalid if they do not have a label set.
 *
 * Presentation properties are marked as such, and affect future requests.
 * Any pending requests will use the values of the presentation properties at the time of the request.
 *
 * <B>Note:</B> Once the dialog is displayed after a call to @c show() or @c exec() there are two ways of updating the dialog after changing its presentation properties.
 *
 * The default way is to update all the necessary presentation properties and call the @c update() method.
 * This guarantees that all the presentation properties will be updated at the same time.
 *
 * The second method is to have the dialog update automatically after every presentation property change. To enable these automatic updates,
 * the @c autoUpdateEnabled property must be set to @c true.
 *
 * Be aware that the second method does not guarantee atomic updates for all the presentation properties changes.
 * This method can lead to noticeable delays between updates of individual properties. If more than one property needs to be updated, use the first method.
 * If only one presentation property is being updated frequently
 * (for example the text on the dialog @c body must be updated to notify the user of the application's current status)
 * the second approach can be used.
