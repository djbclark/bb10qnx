 *
 * @brief An interface for populating a menu of invokable items.
 *
 * The menu service provides common context-aware logic for building menus. It
 * can construct menus based on a specified type of data. The menu service
 * uses the data, its type, and the context in which the data is being acted on
 * to build a menu and populate it with information to be displayed and with the
 * actions to be performed when an item in the menu is selected.
 *
 * To build a menu of invokable items, create an instance of
 * the @c MenuManager class, populate the required parameters
 * using the setter methods, and call @c populateMenu() to send
 * the request.
 *
 * The menu service populates menus based on the context of the
 * data being acted upon. The data being acted upon can be specified
 * using a combination of URI, MIME type, and the data being acted upon.
 * Typically, the data will be specified using one of these combinations:
 * - Specify the URI to the data. The type of the data will be inferred by
 *   the menu service.
 * - Specify the URI to the data and the MIME type of the data to which the URI refers.
 * - Specify the data and its MIME type.
 *
 * If all three properties are specified, then the MIME type shall be
 * assumed to be the MIME type of the data referenced by the URI.
 *
 * Connect to the @c finished() signal to receive a notification that
 * the menu service has completed the request. Call @c error() to
 * check that the request was successful; if so, retrieve the
 * populated menu using @c menu().
 *
 * Here's an example of how to send a request, receive the response,
 * and read the menu data.
 *
 * @code
 *
 * // Populate the query parameters.
 * bb::system::MenuManager *_menuManager = new MenuManager;
 * _menuManager->setUri(QUrl("file://path/to/file"));
 * _menuManager->setTargetTypes(InvokeTarget::Application);
 *
 * // Connect to the finished() signal.
 * connect(_menuManager, SIGNAL(finished()), this, SLOT(onFinished()));
 *
 * // Send the request to have the menu populated.
 * if (_menuManager->populateMenu() != true) {
 *     // Handle the error.
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * @code
 * // Define a slot to receive the finished() signal.
 * Q_SLOT void onFinished()
 * {
 *     // Check for errors.
 *     if (_menuManager->error() != MenuManagerError::None) {
 *         // Handle the error.
 *     } else {
 *         // The menu was populated. Retrieve the data.
 *         bb::system::Menu = _menuManager->menu();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * @xmlonly
 * <apigrouping group="User Interface/System UI"/>
 * <library name="bbsystem"/>
