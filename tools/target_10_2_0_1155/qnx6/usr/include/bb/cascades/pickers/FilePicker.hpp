*
* @brief  Allows the user to select a file or select a name and location for saving a file.
*
* @details
*
* The FilePicker class in Picker mode allows the user to traverse the folder hierarchy to select a file.
* The application invoking the FilePicker can provide the types of the files that are allowed and in
* the case of multiple file types, the default file type.
*
* The application invoking the FilePicker can also provide a custom filter and/or the directory that FilePicker displays when it opens. This
* overrides the filter and folders associated with the file type. The filter is a list of string patterns that supports wildcards.
* For example, if the filter string is "*.jpg", FilePicker lists files where the file has an extension of ".jpg".
*
* The user can click a file to make a selection, or press the Cancel button. In the first case, FilePicker emits the fileSelected()
* signal and closes. If the user presses the Cancel button, FilePicker emits the canceled() signal before closing.  In addition FilePicker emits
* error () signal and closes if it encounters an error that forces it to close.
*
* FilePicker can be opened in Saver mode. In this mode, the application invoking the FilePicker can provide the file type of
* content and the default name and location to save the content to. FilePicker displays the content of the default folder associated with the file type.
* The user can change the location and/or default name.
*
* FilePicker supports two view modes - List view and Grid view. The view mode is chosen based on the selected file type
* to display the content in the best possible way. For example, pictures and videos are displayed as a grid and documents are displayed as a list.
* While viewing, the user can toggle between list and grid view modes. The application can specify the view mode that FilePicker uses for display.
* This overrides the default view mode.
*
* The default view in the FilePicker is the content on the local device. However, the user can access sources other than on the local device,
* for example, Cloud services, USB, and so on.
*
* In QML, you must prefix the absolute file path of an external resource with @c  file:// or your app won't be able to access the resource.
* File paths returned from @c FilePicker must be prefixed with @c  file:// to be used as an absolute path to @c ImageView or @c MediaPlayer.
*
* The following example creates a FilePicker in Picker mode with a file type of Picture:
*
* @code
*       FilePicker* filePicker = new FilePicker();
*       filePicker->setType(FileType::Picture);
*       filePicker->setTitle("Select Picture");
*       filePicker->setMode(FilePickerMode::Picker);
*       filePicker->open();
*
*       // Connect the fileSelected() signal with the slot.
*       QObject::connect(filePicker, 
*           SIGNAL(fileSelected(const QStringList&)), 
*           this, 
*           SLOT(onFileSelected(const QStringList&)));
* 
*       // Connect the canceled() signal with the slot.
*       QObject::connect(filePicker, 
*           SIGNAL(canceled()), 
*           this, 
*           SLOT(onCanceled()));
* @endcode
*
* The above example creates a FilePicker and sets the title as "Select Picture".
* FilePicker initially displays the contents of folders associated with the file type Picture,
* e.g. /accounts/1000/shared/photos, and displays only files that match the Picture file type.
*
* The following example creates a FilePicker in Saver mode with a file type of Document.
*
* @code
* FilePicker* filePicker = new FilePicker(FileType::Document, 0, 
*     QStringList(), QStringList(), QStringList("ImportantDoc.doc"));
* filePicker->setMode(FilePickerMode::Saver);
* filePicker->open();
* @endcode
*
* In the above example, FilePicker displays the contents of the folder associated with the file type Document and displays the
* default file name, "ImportantDoc.doc". The user can change the name or location and click the save button to return to the application.
*
* In Saver mode, the user can either click the Cancel Button or the Save Button. In the first case, FilePicker emits the fileSelected()
* signal and closes, returning control back to the calling application. If the user clicks the Cancel button, FilePicker
* emits the canceled() signal before closing.
*
* Here is example of using FilePicker in QML:
*
* @code
*   import bb.cascades.pickers 1.0
*
*       Page {
*           content: Container {
*               Button {
*                   text: "FilePicker from QML"
*                   onClicked: {
*                       filePicker.open()
*                   }
*               }
*           }
*           attachedObjects: [
*               FilePicker {
*                   id:filePicker
*                   type : FileType.Picture
*                   title : "Select Picture"
*                   directories : ["/accounts/1000/shared/misc"]
*                   onFileSelected : {
*                       console.log("FileSelected signal received : " + selectedFiles);
*
*                       //make sure to prepend "file://" when using as a source for an ImageView or MediaPlayer
*                       myImageView.imageSource = "file://" + selectedFiles[0];
*
*                   }
*               }
*           ]
