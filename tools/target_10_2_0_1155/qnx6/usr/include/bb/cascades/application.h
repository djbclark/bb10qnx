     * 
     * @brief The class provides an event loop and handles application's menu scene, and main window.
     *
     * Cascades applications must use this class and not @c QCoreApplication or @c QApplication.
     *
     * The @c %Application class provides an event loop and an event delivery
     * mechanism for Cascades applications as well as providing the
     * following properties:
     * - #scene : specifies the @c AbstractPane to be used as the scene for the main application window
     * - #cover : specifies the @c AbstractCover to be used when the application is in cover mode (also known as an Active frame)
     * - #menu : application @c Menu accessible by the user by the swipe from the top of the screen.
     * - #menuEnabled : whether the application @c %Menu is enabled (it can be set to @c true even
     *   when menu isn't set so that it will provide the user with visual feedback that there's
     *   no menu)
     * - #mainWindow : provides access to an object representing applications's main @c Window
     * - #themeSupport : provides access to the theme used in the application
     *
     * Cascades applications are not expected to subclass this class but instead instantiate it and
     * invoke Application::exec() method to start the event loop.
     * Creating Cascades controls and other ui elements is only supported after an instance of
     * Application has been created. It must be created on the application's main thread.
     *
     * An example of simple application:
     * @code
     * #include <bb::cascades::Application>
     * #include <bb::cascades::Button>
     * #include <bb::cascades::Page>
     * 
     * using bb::cascades;
     *
     * int main(int argc, char **argv) {
     *     Application app(argc, argv);
     *
     *     Page *page = Page::create()
     *         .content(Button::create("Hello, World!"));
     *     app.setScene(page);
     *
     *     return app.exec();
     * }
     * @endcode
     *
     * Here's an example of an equivalent QML-based application. Note that the document loading
     * error checking is omitted (see @c QmlDocument for proper error checking).
     *
     * @code
     * // hello.qml file
     *
     * Page {
     *     Button { text: "Hello, World!" }
     * }
     * @endcode
     *
     * @code
     * // hello.cpp file
     *
     * #include <bb::cascades::Application>
     * #include <bb::cascades::QmlDocument>
     * #include <bb::cascades::Page>
     * 
     * using bb::cascades;
     *
     * int main(int argc, char **argv) {
     *     Application app(argc, argv);
     *
     *     QmlDocument *qml = QmlDocument::create(&app, "hello.qml");
     *     Page *page = qml->createRootObject<Page>();
     *     app.setScene(page);
     *
     *     return app.exec();
     * }
     * @endcode
     *
     * The @c Application instance is exposed to QML as a context property called "Application".
     * 
     * Here's an example of accessing the Application instance from QML:
     *
     * @code
     * Button {
     *     text: (Application.menuEnabled ? "Disable" : "Enable") 
     *             + " Application Menu"
     *     onClicked: Application.menuEnabled = !Application.menuEnabled;
     * }
     * @endcode 
     *
     * @xmlonly
     * <apigrouping group="User interface/Application structure"/>
     * <qml>
     * <class contextProperty="Application" />
     * </qml>
     * @endxmlonly
     *
     * @since BlackBerry 10.0.0
