/**
 * @brief Converts KML data content into a @c DataProvider.
 * The @c DataProvider instance contains various geographic elements
 * that are created as a result of parsing this KML content. Its ID is
 * set to the unique ID available within the KML content itself.
 *
 * The returned object is owned by the calling client,
 * which must delete the associated memory. Note, when the returned
 * object is passed to a @c MapData instance, then that @c MapData becomes
 * the owner of the data, and the deletion of memory is handled by the
 * @c MapData.
 *
 * @param kmlContent The KML content ready to be parsed.
 * @return The @c DataProvider instance that holds the geographic entities that
 * correspond to the KML data, or @c NULL if an error occurred during the
 * parsing of KML content. If no supported geographic elements were encountered
 * (e.g. Placemarks), but the parsing itself was successful, then an
 * empty data provider is returned.
