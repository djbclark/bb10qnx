/**
 * @headerfile MapData.hpp <bb/cascades/maps/MapData>
 *
 * @brief A collection of data providers to be represented on a map.
 *
 * Object Ownership
 * ----------------
 * This class is under the ownership of the client application. The
 * client is responsible for creating and destroying this object.
 * However, if the client wants to link the lifetime of this object
 * with a @c MapView instance, then the client needs to explicitly set
 * this object as the child of the @c MapView.
 *
 * When a @c DataProvider instance is given to this object, it becomes
 * a child of this object. When this object is destroyed, so
 * are all of the @c DataProviders inside of it. Additionally, a single
 * @c DataProvider instance cannot be shared across multiple @c MapData
 * instances.
 *
 * @c Geographic elements that are added to this class have their parent set
 * to that of the default provider (see below). Since this class is the parent
 * of that @c DataProvider, this class becomes the indirect parent of the
 * added @c Geographic.
 *
 *
 * Reference Type
 * --------------
 * @c MapData is expected to be used as a <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_type">reference type</a>.
 * As such, care needs to be made when referencing this object in
 * multi-threaded environments. For example, deletion in one thread can
 * cause a dangling pointer in another thread.
 *
 * Also note that the contents of this container
 * (@c bb::platform::geo::DataProvider) are also reference types.
 *
 * Default Provider
 * ----------------
 * Every @c MapData instance has a default @c DataProvider. This object is
 * available to the client to store client created data (such as
 * GeoLocations), without requiring them to create a provider, or
 * write their own provider.
 *
 * The default provider cannot be removed.
