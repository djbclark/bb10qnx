 * @headerfile RenderEngine.hpp <bb/cascades/maps/RenderEngine>
 *
 * @brief The common interface for all rendering engine implementations.
 *
 * Communication Between MapView and RenderEngine
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * The only object that directly talks to a render engine instance is the
 * @c MapView class. A majority of the operations triggered by @c MapView are
 * synchronous in nature, and thus are blocking. Some of these calls could
 * be executed on the main GUI event thread (for example,
 * @c RenderEngine::windowToWorld). The exception to this is slot operations.
 * These are executed asynchronously using Qt's queued messaging system.
 *
 * Synchronous methods need to return **very** promptly. If they require
 * longer, a separate thread should be spawned to turn it into an
 * asynchronous operation.
 *
 * Render Engine Timeline
 * ----------------------
 * Creation and Metadata: The render engine instance will be created using
 * the default, empty constructor. At that point, the framework can query
 * the properties of the engine. At this point, the engine should not be
 * consuming any significant portion of memory.
 *
 * Configuration: Once it has been determined that the engine is going
 * to be used, its initialize() operation is called to set up the engine.
 * At this point, the engine can set itself up, ready to perform renders.
 *
 * Render Cycle: While an engine is in use, its render() operation
 * will be executed in a separate thread. It is at this point that the
 * engine needs to convert geographic data into OpenGL calls. Once a single
 * render cycle has completed, the renderCompleted() signal has to be
 * emitted so that the framework is notified.
 *
 * The render cycle needs to complete in a timely fashion. If a long-term
 * process needs to be performed (such as downloading data), then the action
 * should be initiated off-thread and the @c render() operation completed.
 * Once the long-term process has completed, the render can resume, and
 * then the @c renderCompleted() signal can be emitted.
 *
 * Closure: Once the framework has finished with the engine (but before
 * destruction), the @c teardown() operation will be executed. At this point,
 * the engine instance should clean up as much as possible. However, it may
 * be reconfigured / re-initiated again using the @c initialize() operation.
 * (The @c teardown() operation will be executed on the thread with @c MapView
 * affinity: the GUI thread.)
 *
 * Destruction: The engine's destructor is only called once the
 * framework is, itself, destructed.
 *
 * Note: Due to the fact that the engine may be in memory, but not in
 * use, it is important that the engine be as memory efficient as possible.
 * Thus, only between the @c initialize() and @c teardown() states should the
 * engine consider itself "actively rendering".
 *
 * Memory Management
 * -----------------
 * When an instance of this class is handed to a @c MapView instance, the
 * @c MapView claims ownership of the render engine. Thus, @c MapView is
 * responsible for the destruction of the @c RenderEngine when it has been
 * given to the @c MapView.
 *
 * Reference Data and Thread Safety
 * --------------------------------
 * @c RenderEngine implementations need to be aware that the @c MapData
 * object is not thread safe. As such, care needs to be taken with
 * dangling pointers to @c Geographic and @c DataProvider objects.
 *
 * How to Make a RenderEngine a Plug-in
 * ------------------------------------
 * @c RenderEngine instances can be automatically discovered and used by
 * @c MapView if they follow a plug-in format. To do this:
 *
 * - Have the engine subclass @c RenderEngine
 *
 * - Declare it as an implementation of the @c RenderEngine interface by using
 * the @c Q_INTERFACES macro, which gets placed under the @c Q_OBJECT macro
 * in the engine's header file:
 * @code
 * Q_INTERFACES( bb::cascades::maps::RenderEngine )
 * @endcode
 *
 * - Export the engine as a plug-in using the @c Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2 macro,
 * where @c project_target is the name of the project's @c TARGET value
 * in the @c .pro file, and @c plugin_classname is the name of the class
 * extending RenderEngine:
 * @code
 * Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2( project_target, plugin_classname )
 * @endcode
 * The macro gets placed at the bottom of the engine's CPP implementation
 * file.
 *
 * - Build the engine as a plugin, and bundle it as a shared library by
 * adding the following to the project's @c .pro file:
 * @code
 * CONFIG += shared plugin
 * @endcode
 *
 * - Deploy the plugin library to one of the following locations:
 *   - <tt>/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/mapview-renderengine</tt> - for system-wide
 *     plugins
 *   - <tt>[application root]/app/native/lib/mapview-renderengine</tt> -
 *     for application specific plugins.
 *
 * Target Audience
 * ---------------
 * This class is designed for clients wishing to extend MapView only.
