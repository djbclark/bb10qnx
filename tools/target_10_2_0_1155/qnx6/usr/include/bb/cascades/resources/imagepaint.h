     * 
     * @brief A representation of a image that can be used as a fill.
     *
     * @c %ImagePaint is typically used for tileable images. A tileable
     * image is one that can be repeated as a pattern over a surface.
     *
     * If set as a background of a @c Container the paint will fill the area
     * occupied by the container. Depending on the specified repeat pattern
     * the image will either be repeated in particular direction or stretched
     * to fill the available area. The anchor point of the repeat is the top left corner
     * of the fillable area.
     * 
     * This class uses @c RepeatPattern to specify how and if the image should
     * be repeated over the surface. In order to construct ImagePaint objects
     * from QML, the @c ImagePaintDefinition class is available.
     *
     * The provided image must have a width and height that
     * is a power of two in order to be tileable (for example, 
     * 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 128x64, 32x16). It also needs to
     * have the "repeatable: true|false" property set in the asset metadata
     * file. The asset metadata file is an .amd file with the same name as
     * the image itself. This file can also contain nine-slicing attributes, however
     * the tiling of nine-sliced images is not currently supported.
     *
     * Here's an example of an .amd file called tiled_image.amd that has the repeatable property set to true.
     *
     * @code
     * #RimCascadesAssetMetaData version=1.0
     * source: "tiled_image.png"
     * repeatable: true
     * @endcode
     *
     * When referencing the image from your application, you reference the .amd file
     * instead of the image itself. Here's an example of how to tile the background image
     * in a container in C++:
     *
     * @code
     * pContainer->setBackground(ImagePaint("asset:///tiled_image.amd", RepeatPattern::XY));
     * @endcode
     * 
     * <h2>Tiling images using ImageData</h2>
     *
     * You can also tile images defined by the @c ImageData class:
     *
     * @code
     * #include <bb/ImageData>
     *
     * int w = 0x33333333;
     * int b = 0000000000;
     * int data[8][8] =
     *     { { w, b, b, b, b, b, b, w },
     *       { b, w, b, b, b, b, w, b },
     *       { b, b, w, w, w, w, b, b },
     *       { b, b, w, b, b, w, b, b },
     *       { b, b, w, b, b, w, b, b },
     *       { b, b, w, w, w, w, b, b },
     *       { b, w, b, b, b, b, w, b },
     *       { w, b, b, b, b, b, b, w } };
     * 
     * Image image(bb::ImageData::fromPixels((const unsigned char*)data, bb::PixelFormat::RGBX, 8, 8, 8*4));
     * ImagePaint paint(image, RepeatPattern::XY);
     * pContainer->setBackground(paint);
     * @endcode
     * 
     * <h2>Tiling images in QML</h2>
     *
     * In order to tile images in QML, you must use the associated definition class @c ImagePaintDefinition.
     * Here's an example of how to use @c %ImagePaintDefinition to add a background image to a container in QML:
     *
     * @code 
     * Container {
     *     id: rootContainer
     *     background: back.imagePaint
     *     attachedObjects: [
     *         ImagePaintDefinition {
     *             id: back
     *             repeatPattern: RepeatPattern.XY
     *             imageSource: "asset:///container/tiled/core16x16.amd"
     *         }
     *     ]
     * }   
     * @endcode
     * 
     * @see @c Image, @c ImagePaintDefinition, @c bb::ImageData
     *
     * @xmlonly
     * <apigrouping group="User interface/Resources"/>
     * @endxmlonly
