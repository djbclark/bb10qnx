        /*!
         * @brief Specifies how and if an image should be repeated within a container.
         *
         * The @c %RepeatPattern::Type is used by @c ImagePaint and @c ImagePaintDefinition to specify if and how the image
         * should be repeated over the filled area.
         *
         * The possible values are
         * - Fill: stretches the image to fit assigned area without preserveing image's aspect ratio
         * - X: image is repeated along X-axis and is stretched in the Y-axis direction
         * - Y: image is repeated along Y-axis and is stretched in the X-axis direction
         * - XY: image is repeated along X-axis and Y-axis
         *
         * If repeat is set and the area dimensions are not exact multiples of the source
         * image dimensions, the final images in the repeat sequence will be
         * cut off in order to preserve the area.
         *
         * The provided image must also have a width and height that
         * is a power of two in order to be tileable (for example, 
         * 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 128x64, 32x16). It also needs to
         * have the "repeatable: true|false" property set in the asset metadata
         * file. The asset metadata file is an .amd file with the same name as
         * the image itself. This file can also contain nine-slicing attributes, however
         * the tiling of nine-sliced images is not currently supported.
         *
         * Here's an example of an .amd file called tiled_image.amd that has the repeatable property set to true.
         *
         * @code
         * #RimCascadesAssetMetaData version=1.0
