         * @brief An image resource, the source of which might not be known.
         *
         * Images can come from a number of different sources, the most common of
         * which is as an asset that is packaged with the application. This is the
         * type of image that is commonly used in the user interface.
         *
         * One of the benefits of packaging an image with the application is that it allows the tool
         * to verify the images and optimize them for the devices they are targeting. Because they
         * are packaged with the application, it should be assumed that they are instantly available,
         * and should never fail to load. If an incorrect @c name is provided when an asset is created,
         * an null image is returned.
         *
         * As long as the image is placed in the assets folder in your
         * project, you can refer to it using a relative path to the assets directory (@c asset:///)
         * followed by the file name. For example:
         *
         * @code
         * Image imageAsset = Image(QUrl("asset:///myasset.png"));
         * @endcode
         *
         * The absolute path to the assets directory is file:///<em>app_working_directory</em>/app/native.
         *
         * <h2>Images outside the assets directory</h2>
         *
         * Each application has access to its own working directory in the file system.
         * The working directory is where application is started, and is also known as the
         * "current directory" and the "sandbox."
         *
         * Within the application working directory, there are a number of folders that
         * your application has access to. The @c data folder (otherwise known as the
         * "home" directory) contains your application's private data. Here's an example
         * of how to use a path relative to the application working directory to load an
         * image from the home directory:
         *
         * @code
         * Image image = Image(QUrl("file://" + QDir::homePath() + "/image2.png"));
         * @endcode
         *
         * Your application can also access folders outside the application working directory, in
         * a shared folder. Here's an example of how to load an image from the shared/camera folder
         * (provided that you set the appropriate permissions for it in your bar-descriptor.xml file).
         * In this example, an absolute path is used:
         *
         * @code
         * Image image = Image(QUrl("file:///accounts/1000/shared/camera/camera0001.jpg"));
         * @endcode
         *
         * <h2>Images in QML</h2>
         *
         * Here are some examples of how to use an @c %Image in QML:
         *
         * @code
         * ImageView {
         *     imageSource: "asset:///myAsset.png"
         * }
         * 
         * Button {
         *     imageSource: "images/button.png"
         * }
         *    
         * ImageTracker {
         *     id: anImage
         *     imageSource: "asset:///myAsset.png"
         * }
         *    
         * ImageView {
         *     image: anImage.image
         * }
         * @endcode
         *
         * <h2>Loading an image</h2>
         *
         * When dealing with images that are not assets (i.e. not packaged with the application),
         * it should be assumed that the image might take a considerable time to load, or may
         * not load at all. To account for this, an @c %Image goes through a 
         * series of states indicating when the image is loaded and if 
         * an error occurred. The state of an image and information about its size are accessible through 
         * @c ImageTracker, which encapsulates the asynchronous parts of the Image.
         *
         * Here's an example showing how to load an image and display it when it is
         * successfully loaded, in C++:
         *
         *
         * @code
         * void MyApp::setup() {
         *     mImageView = new ImageView();
         *     mImageTracker = new ImageTracker(QUrl("assets/image.png"));
         *
         *     bool result = connect(mImageTracker,
         *         SIGNAL(stateChanged(bb::cascades::ResourceTracker::State)),
         *         this,
         *         SLOT(onStateChanged(bb::cascades::ResourceTracker::State)));
         *
         *     Q_ASSERT(result);
         *     Q_UNUSED(result);
         *   
         *     // ...
         * }
         *
         * void MyApp::onStateChanged(ResourceTracker::State state)
         * {
         *     if(state == ResourceTracker::Loaded)
         *     {
         *         mImageView->setImage(mImageTracker->image());
         *     }
         * }
         * @endcode
         *
         * Here's an example in QML showing how to load an image and display it when it is successfully loaded:
         *         
         * @code
         * ImageView {
         *     id: myImageView
         *     attachedObjects: [
         *         ImageTracker {
         *             id: tracker
         *             imageSource: "images/image.png"
         *        
         *             onStateChanged: { 
         *                 if (state == ResourceTracker.Loaded)
         *                 {
         *                     myImageView.image = tracker.image
         *                 }
         *             }
         *         }
         *     ]
         * }
         * @endcode
         *
         * <h2>Creating images from data</h2>
         *
         * It's also possible to create images from raw pixel data using @c ImageData::fromPixels().
         * In order to create the image from a set of data, all you need to specify is the source of the data,
         * the format of the pixel data (as specified by @c PixelFormat), the width and height of the image, and
         * the number of bytes per line in the data source.
         *
         * Here's an example of how to create an image from a random set of pixel data. The pixel format used is RGBX.
         *
         * @image html image_from_data.png
         *
         * @code
         * int data[8][8];
         * for (int y=0;y<8;y++) {
         *     for (int x=0;x<8;x++) {
         *         data[x][y] = rand();
         *     }
         * }
         * Image m_image = bb::ImageData::fromPixels((
         *         const unsigned char*)data, 
         *         bb::PixelFormat::RGBX, 
         *         8, 8, 8*4);
         * @endcode
         *
         * <h2>Nine-slice scaling</h2>
         *
         * @c Image resources can be specified to have nine-slice margins, which can be retrieved using the nineSliceMargin*() methods. 
         * A nine-sliced image will, when displayed, be stretched according to nine-slice rules instead of being simply scaled. 
         *
         * @image html what-is-nine-slice_animation.gif Animated example of a nine-slice image
         *
         * In the animated image above,
         * @li the four corners (1,3,7,9) are not scaled, 
         * @li the left and right 'margins' (4,6) are scaled only vertically (i.e., their width is not touched), 
         * @li and the top and bottom 'margins' (2,8) are scaled only horizontally (i.e., their height is not touched).
         * The center area (5) is the only one that's scaled both horizontally and vertically.
         *
         * To specify that the image is nine-sliced place a metadata file with the same name but ".amd" extension next to 
         * the image (i.e., in the same directory) and specify the nine-slices with the following format: 
         * @code
         * sliceMargins: l r t b
         * @endcode
         * Where "l" is the left slice margin, "r" is the right margin, "t" is the top margin and "b" is the bottom margin. 
         *
         * With reference to the animated image above:
         * @li  the 'l' parameter is the horizontal size of the areas 1,4, and 7
         * @li  the 'r' parameter is the horizontal size of the areas 3,6, and 9
         * @li  the 't' parameter is the vertical size of the areas 1,2, and 3 
         * @li  the 'b' parameter is the vertical size of the areas 7,8, and 9 
         *
         * For example, if there's a nine-sliced image called "nine_sliced_background.png", the metadata file must be 
         * called "nine_sliced_background.amd" and placed in the same directory as the image. The contents of the
         * file might look something like this depending on the nine-slice margin values for your image:
         * 
         * @code
         * #RimCascadesAssetMetaData version=1.0
         * source: "nine_sliced_background.png"
         * sliceMargins: 63 62 51 123
         * @endcode
         *
         * In your application, you simply reference the .amd file instead of the image and whenever it's scaled
         * the image will maintain its edges.
         *
         * @code
         * ImageView {
         *     imageSource: "asset:///nine_sliced_background.amd"
         *     preferredWidth: 500
         *     preferredHeight: 500
         * }
         * @endcode
         *
         * In the metadata file, lines beginning with '#' are ignored, and can be used for comments.
         *
         * <h2>Tiling images</h2>
         *
         * Using the @c ImagePaint (C++) and @c ImagePaintDefinition (QML) classes you can use images
         * as background fill for a container. The @c RepeatPattern class determines how/if the image
         * is tiled on the container.
         *
         * In order for an image to be tileable, it must have the "repeatable: true|false" property set in the asset metadata
         * file. This is the same .amd file that can contain nine-slicing attributes, however
         * the tiling of nine-sliced images is not currently supported.
         *
