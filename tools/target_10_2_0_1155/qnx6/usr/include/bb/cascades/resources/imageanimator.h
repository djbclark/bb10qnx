             * Example 2:
             *   -# Invoke <code>stopAt(ImageAnimatorAnchor::FirstFrame, ImageAnimatorSeekMode::Immediate)</code> while animation is running.
             *   -# @c startedChanged(false) will be emitted immediately.

             *      @c runningChanged(false) will be emitted.
             *
             * Example 3:

             *      @c runningChanged(false) will be emitted.

             * Example 4:
             *   -# Invoke <code>stopAt(ImageAnimatorAnchor::FirstFrame, ImageAnimatorSeekMode::Animate)</code> while animation is running.
             *   -# @c startedChanged(false) will be emitted immediately.

             *      @c runningChanged(false) will be emitted.

             *   -# @c startedChanged(false) will be emitted immediately.

             *      @c runningChanged(false) will be emitted.
             *
             * Example 6:
             *   -# Invoke <code>stopAt(ImageAnimatorAnchor::FirstFrame, ImageAnimatorSeekMode::Animate)</code> while animation is not running
             *       and the first frame is not currently showing.
             *   -# Cascades will emit @c runningChanged(true), run the animation until the first frame is shown, at which point
