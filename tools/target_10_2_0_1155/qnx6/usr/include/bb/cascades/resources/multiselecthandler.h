   /*!
    * @brief A handler used during multiple selection to populate the Context Menu.
    *
    * The multi-select handler represents a multiple selection session involving the Context Menu.
    * Only one multi-select handler can be active at at time. The @c active property tells whether
    * the handler is active or not. Setting the @c active property to @c true will start multiple
    * selection with this handler and cancel any other handler that was active. During multiple 
    * selection the Context Menu is shown populated with the actions from the current handler. 
    *
    * The @c %MultiSelectHandler can be specified as an attached object in any control or specified in
    * the ListView as a multiSelectHandler property.
    *
    * There are some special cases where you will get a lot for free from the @c %MultiSelectHandler:
    *
    * If you add the @c %MultiSelectHandler to a ListView and that @c %MultiSelectHandler has the
    * multiSelectAction property set, the ListItems will automatically have a MultiSelectActionItem in
    * their context menu. If One of the ListItems have the multiSelectAction property set that
    * MultiSelectActionItem will override the one set in the @c %MultiSelectHandler, but just for that
    * specific ListItem type.
    *
    * If you have a MultiSelectActionItem connected to your @c %MultiSelectHandler that item will activate
    * the handler automatically. However, if you add a MultiSelectActionItem to a control, then you must connect 
    * the signals and activate the desired @c %MultiSelectHandler manually.
    *
