         * @brief Abstract base class inherited by all resources.
         *
         * A resource is content that is usually provided at runtime or is generated dynamically, as opposed to 
         * assets which are usually packaged with the application. Resources can therefore
         * be slower to load and might even fail to load in some situations (for example, with corrupt data or a bad network 
         * connection).
         *
         * All resources go through several states during loading. To 
         * listen to the state changes and get other data from the resource, a 
         * ResourceTracker must be used (for example, an ImageTracker is used when listening for state 
         * changes on an Image). The ResourceTracker encapsulates the asynchronous behavior of a 
         * resource by providing means to receive signals and access resource data and states. 
         * 
         * Resources are value objects that use implicit data sharing, which allow them to be 
         * passed around as values.
         *
