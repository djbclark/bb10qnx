     * 
     * @brief Represents a QML document that can be loaded into a C++ application.
     *
     * QML documents are loaded using a specified asset name. QML documents are considered
     * to be assets, meaning that they should be packaged with the application.
     *
     * All documents loaded with this class will share the same QDeclarativeEngine
     * which is associated with the application. However, each document will have
     * its own QDeclarativeContext derived from the root context of the shared application
     * engine. Properties of this context can be set using QmlDocument::setContextProperty() method.
     * The shared context is accessible via the QmlDocument::documentContext() method. New
     * contexts can be derived from this context and used for creating root nodes.
     *
     * Once the document is successuflly loaded using the builder's QmlDocument::Builder::load(const QString&) method
     * (one should use QmlDocument::hasErrors() method to check whether the document was loaded
     * successfully) a root node can be instantiated for the tree represented by
     * this document using the QmlDocument::createRootObject() template method. The root node must
     * be a derivative of the UIObject class. Multiple root nodes can be instantiated from
     * the same QmlDocument instance. It is possible to specify a context to create a root
     * node with, in case a derived context needs to be created.
     *
     * During the instantiation of the root node, the UIObject::creationCompleted() signal
     * will be emitted for all UIObjects in the tree.
     *
     * Note that the context properties should be set prior to instantiating the
     * root node of the document.
     *
     * A note regarding ownership of the objects associated with the QmlDocument object.
     * By default the QmlDocument object is owned by the Application instance and will have
     * the lifespan of the application. If the user wants to handle the lifespan
     * the QObject::setParent method can be used to transfer the ownership.
     * If the QmlDocument instance is only used for creating a single instance of the root object
     * this root object can be set as a parent of the QmlDocument instance so the latter will
     * be deleted when the node instance is deleted.
     *
     * The QmlDocument object owns its encapsulated context and declarative component. The
     * user is responsible for all contexts derived from the shared document's context.
     * The declarative engine is owned by the application instance and must not
     * be deleted.
     *
     * The root nodes created using QmlDocument::createRootObject() are owned by
     * the user. The QmlDocument object which was used to create the root node
     * must have longer lifespan than the root nodes themselves.
     *
     * This example shows how to load and instantiate a QmlDocument document:
     * @code
     * QmlDocument *qml = QmlDocument::create("asset:///ApplicationScreen.qml");
     * if (!qml->hasErrors()) {
     *     Page *page = qml->createRootObject<Page>();
     *     if (page) {
     *         setScene(page);
     *     }
     * }
     * // qml object is owned by the application
     * @endcode
     *
     * Here's an example of loading and instantiating a QmlDocument document and setting
     * shared context properties:
     *
     * @code
     * QmlDocument *qml = QmlDocument::create("asset:///ApplicationScreen.qml")
     *    // Sets shared context property myObject to 'this'
     *    .property("myObject", this)
     *    // Sets shared context property myData to 'dataObject'     
     *    .property("myData", dataObject);
     *
     * if (!qml->hasErrors()) {
     *     Page *page= qml->createRootObject<Page>();
     *     if (page) {
     *         setScene(page);
     *     }
     * }
     * @endcode
     *
     * Here's an example of creating a root node with a derived context:
     *
     * @code
     * QmlDocument *qml = QmlDocument::create("asset:///ApplicationScreen.qml");
     * if (!qml->hasErrors()) {
     *     QDeclarativeContext *derivedContext1 = 
     *             new QDeclarativeContext(qml->documentContext());
     *     derivedContext1->setContextProperty("myObject", this);
     *     derivedContext1->setContextProperty("myData", dataObject1);
     *
     *     // Create a control with derived declarative context
     *     Control *control1 =
     *             qml->createRootObject<Control>(derivedContext1);
     *
     *     // Now create another root node with a different context
     *     QDeclarativeContext *derivedContext2 =
     *             new QDeclarativeContext(qml->documentContext());
     *     derivedContext2->setContextProperty("myObject", that);
     *     derivedContext2->setContextProperty("myData", dataObject2);
     *     Control *control2 =
     *             qml->createRootObject<Control>(derivedContext2);
     *
     *     // A way to ensure the context doesn't get leaked
     *     derivedContext->setParent(control2);
     *
     *     // ... use the created controls
     * }
     * @endcode
