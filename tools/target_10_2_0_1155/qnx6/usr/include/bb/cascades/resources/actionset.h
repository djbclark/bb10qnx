    * 
    * @brief Used to group a set of actions to be displayed in the Context Menu.
    *
    * The Context Menu is a menu that is displayed by pressing and holding a control. It
    * displays a set of actions that are relevant for that particular control.
    *
    * An example is an application showing a list of emails where the user can press and hold
    * a particular email to show the Context Menu. The menu could then typically show
    * actions such as "Reply", "Forward" and "Read".
    *
    * It is possible to specify several @c %ActionSet objects on the same control. Currently, 
    * only the first @c %ActionSet is used.
    *
    * Here is an example of how to specify @c %ActionSet objects, in QML:
    *
    * @code
    * ImageView {
    *     imageSource: "john.png"
    *     contextActions: [
    *         ActionSet {
    *             title: "Email"
    *             subtitle: "From: John Doe"
    *             ActionItem {title: "Reply"}
    *             ActionItem {title: "Forward"}
    *         },
    *         ActionSet {
    *             title: "Sender"
    *             ActionItem {title: "Call"}
    *             ActionItem {title: "Send SMS"}
    *         }
    *     ]
    * }
    * @endcode
    *
    * Here is an example of how to specify @c %ActionSet objects, in C++:
    *
    * @code
    * ImageView* imageView = ImageView::create("john.png");
    * ActionSet* actionSet = ActionSet::create()
    *            .title("Email")
    *            .subtitle("From: John Doe")
    *            .add(ActionItem::create().title("Reply"))
    *            .add(ActionItem::create().title("Forward"));
    * imageView->addActionSet(actionSet);
    * @endcode
