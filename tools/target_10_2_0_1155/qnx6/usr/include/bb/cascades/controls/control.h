        * @brief Requests focus to this control.
        *
        * When requesting focus for a control, you must ensure that the control is currently
        * a part of the scene.
        *
        * A common use case for requesting focus is when a new @c Page is loaded into the scene.
        * For example, on a page that requires text input from the user, you might want to request
        * focus on a @c TextField as soon as the page loads so that the keyboard is automatically displayed.
        * In this scenario, the natural assumption might be to
        * request focus within the page's @c BaseObject::creationCompleted() signal, which is emitted once the object's
        * construction is complete. However, this approach is incorrect. Even though the object has been created, it
        * has not yet been added to the UI tree, so the call would fail.
        *
        * Here are two different methods that you can use for requesting focus. The first method involves listening for
        * changes to the @c Application::scene property. Here's a .qml file called RequestFocusPage.qml, which contains
        * a @c TextField that you want to request focus for as soon as the page loads. The page contains a @c variant property
        * that is bound to the application's @c scene property. When you declare a variable in QML, a value-change signal
        * is implicitly created as well. So, whenever this page gets added to the scene, the @c onAppSceneChanged() signal handler
        * is called where it's safe to request focus for the control.
        *
        * @snippet tad/examples/controls/controlrequestfocus/assets/RequestFocusPage.qml requestfocus_qml1
        *
        * The second method involves using a @c ComponentDefinition to load the pages. Here's another version
        * called RequestFocusPage2.qml. It contains a Boolean property called @c readyForFocus which is
        * initialized to @c false. When the value changes, the @c onreadyForFocusChanged() signal handler
        * is called and focus is requested.
        *
        * @snippet tad/examples/controls/controlrequestfocus/assets/RequestFocusPage2.qml requestfocus_qml2
        *
        * Here's how you can create the @c Page and set the @c readyForFocus property from
        * a @c ComponentDefinition in a @c NavigationPane:
        *
        * @snippet tad/examples/controls/controlrequestfocus/assets/main.qml requestfocus_qml3
