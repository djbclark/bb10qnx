     * @brief A control that allows users to select an option from a drop-down.
     *
     * @image html dropdown.png Example of what the @c DropDown looks like
     *
     * The @c %DropDown control consists of a title bar and an expandable list of options.
     * The purpose is to provide a simple way to let the user select one out of a number of options.
     * The list expands and collapses when tapping on the title bar, and collapses when tapping on an option in the list.
     *
     * When the @c %DropDown is expanded, a list of options is shown. Each option displays a title with an optional
     * description and/or image.
     *
     * When the @c %DropDown is collapsed and an option is selected, the selected option's text is displayed to the right
     * in the title bar.
     * The title and description of the selected option are formatted as follows:
     * - In expanded mode, only the title is shown with the full available area at its disposal.
     * - If either the title or description is shorter than half the available area, it gets its preferred width and the other one uses the rest of the space. 
     *   For example, if the title uses 25% of the area, the description uses 75% (and might be truncated).
     * - If both the title and description are wider than 50% of the available area, they share the space equally (50% for each) with a smaller padding applied in between.
     *
     * When an option is selected, the list collapses and the @c selectedIndexChanged() signal is emitted.
     * The selected option also emits its @c Option::selectedChanged() signal with a parameter of @c true.
     * The previously selected option, if this exists, emits @c Option::selectedChanged() with a parameter of
     * @c false.
     *
     * Adding an option with @c selected set to @c true puts the @c %DropDown control in a selected state.
     * If multiple options are added with @c selected set to @c true, the last option added is selected and
     * the others deselected.
     *
     * Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of a @c %DropDown, in QML:
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/dropdown/assets/main.qml dropdown_qml1
     *
     * And here's an example in C++:
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/dropdown/src/DropDownExamples.cpp dropdown1
     *
     * @xmlonly
     * <apigrouping group="User interface/Core controls"/>
