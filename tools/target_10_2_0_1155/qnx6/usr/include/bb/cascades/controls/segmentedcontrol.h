     * @brief A control that displays a horizontal row of selectable options.
     *
     * @c SegmentedControl allows you to create a horizontal row with up to four visible options. A user can 
     * select one of the options, and you can respond to the selection in your app. For example, you can use
     * a @c %SegmentedControl to filter between different types of the content in your app.
     *
     * The @c %SegmentedControl may be placed on all levels of a drill-down hierarchy. It may also be used
     * inside a @c TabbedPane navigation setup, as a way to navigate between sub-sections inside
     * a specific view. 
     *
     * @image html segmentedcontrol.png Example of what the @c %SegmentedControl looks like
     *
     * Defining a @c %SegmentedControl, with some @c Options, in C++, using the builder pattern:
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/segmentedcontrol/src/SegmentedControlExamples.cpp segmentedcontrol2
     *
     * Defining a @c %SegmentedControl, with some @c Options, in QML:
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/segmentedcontrol/assets/main.qml segmentedcontrol_qml1
     *
     * @c %SegmentedControl uses the @c Option class to represent the segments in the control. The @c text property
     * of the @c Option class is used for the label on the segment, while the @c selected property is used to
     * determine which segment is selected. Changing the selected property on an option updates the selected
     * index of the @c %SegmentedControl.
     *
     * When the @c %SegmentedControl has no options attached to it, it is not displayed. It's not possible to
     * have a @c %SegmentedControl that is displayed without a selected option.
     *
     * When a user presses an option, the @c %SegmentedControl changes its appearance to reflect the newly
     * selected segment, and the @c selectedIndexChanged() signal is emitted. The newly selected option also emits
     * its @c Option::selectedChanged() signal with a parameter of @c true. The previously selected option emits
     * its @c Option::selectedChanged() signal with a parameter of @c false.
     *
     * Adding an @c Option with @c selected set to @c true sets that segment in @c %SegmentedControl as selected.
     * If multiple options are added with @c selected set to @c true, the last option that was added is selected
     * and the others are not selected.
     *
     * The size of the @c %SegmentedControl behaves as follows:
     * - The width and height of the @c %SegmentedControl are device-dependent, built-in values, so:
     *   - Setting the preferred width or height does not affect the size of the @c %SegmentedControl in any way.
     *   - Setting the minimum width or height does not affect the size of the @c %SegmentedControl in any way.
     *   - Setting the maximum width or height does not affect the size of the @c %SegmentedControl in any way.
