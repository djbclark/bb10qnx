 * 
 * @brief Allows for embedding a window from the Screen Graphics Subsystem (Screen window) 
 * into the Cascades scene graph.
 *
 * @image html foreignwindow.png Playing media in a Cascades application with @c %ForeignWindowControl.
 *
 * @note This is an advanced control that requires an understanding of the Screen API. Please see 
 * <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/com.qnx.doc.screen/topic/manual/cscreen_api_components.html">
 * Screen API Developer's guide</a> before using this control.
 * 
 * The @c %ForeignWindowControl is used for embedding a window from the Screen Graphics Subsystem 
 * (Screen window) into the Cascades scene graph. You must specify the @c windowId and/or @c windowHandle, 
 * as well as the @c windowGroup, if it differs from the main window group, in order for the 
 * @c %ForeignWindowControl to bind to a Screen window. When a Screen window matching the specified
 * @c windowId or @c windowHandle is attached to the window group matching @c windowGroup, 
 * @c %ForeignWindowControl will automatically bind to it and its @c boundToWindow property will be 
 * set to @c true. Once the @c %ForeignWindowControl is bound to a Screen window, it will update the
 * properties of the Screen window as specified by @c updatedProperties. You can specify to update Screen
 * window properties such as size and position, so the Screen window stays in sync with the position and size
 * of @c %ForeignWindowControl on the scene.
 *
 * <h4>Window group</h4>
 *
 * In order to be displayed, a Screen window needs to join a window group in the main Cascades window group 
 * hierarchy (either the main group or one of subgroups). The main Cascades window group ID can be obtained 
 * from the main application @c Window through @c Application::instance()->mainWindow()->groupId().
 *
 * <h4>Unbind and rebind</h4>
 *
 * To unbind the @c %ForeignWindowControl from the Screen window, you can call @c unbindFromWindow().
 * The control will be unbound from the Screen window and its @c #boundToWindow property will be set to
 * @c false and @c windowHandle will be set to @c 0. 
 *
 * You can also rebind %ForeignWindowControl to another Screen window in two ways:
 * - You can change the @c windowId, then, when another Screen window matching that 
 * @c windowId or @c windowHandle is attached to a window group matching @c windowGroup, 
 * @c %ForeignWindowControl will be bound to that Screen window. 
 *
 * - Or, you can call @c bindToWindow() method with the new parameters.
 *
 * You cannot create a new Screen context, then a Screen window from that context, then assign 
 * that handle to @c windowHandle. The Screen window must join the main Cascades window group after 
 * the @c %ForeignWindowControl creation, since it must be part of the Cascades Screen context. 
 * So, to rebind another Screen window to @c %ForeignWindowControl, the Screen window must be part 
 * of the main Cascades window group and bound to another or the same @c %ForeignWindowControl.
 * 
 * <h4>Size and layout</h4>
 *
 * You can use @c preferredWidth and @c preferredHeight, and/or @c minWidth, @c minHeight, @c maxWidth,
 * @c maxHeight dimension properties to set the dimensions of the @c %ForeignWindowControl.
 *
 * UI controls placed on top of the @c %ForeignWindowControl in the scene will be rendered overlapping the
 * contents of the @c %ForeignWindowControl. This allows you to display a UI on top of the @c %ForeignWindowControl.
 * UI controls placed underneath the @c %ForeignWindowControl will be completely obscured by the contents 
 * of the @c %ForeignWindowControl.
 *
 * <h4>Signals</h4>
 *
 * Once a Screen window matching the @c windowId and/or @c windowHandle is attached to the window group 
 * matching @c windowGroup, a @c windowAttached() signal is emitted. If @c %ForeignWindowControl was 
 * created after the Screen window was attached to the window group, then the signal will not be emitted.
 *
 * <h4>Z-order</h4>
 *
 * From an implementation view, @c %ForeignWindowControl "punches a hole" in the Cascades UI to allow
 * content of @c %ForeignWindowControl or underneath the Cascades UI to be seen. This implies that the
 * Screen window should be placed below Cascades main window, specifically, having a lower Z-order. 
 * The Z-order on a Screen window is set by the @c SCREEN_PROPERTY_ZORDER window attribute.
 * 
 * Cascades main window has a Z-order of @c 0, so @c %ForeignWindowControl Z-order should be negative. 
 * However, you can set the Z-order to a positive number, but this will make the Screen window to appear
 * on top of the Cascades main window. Screen windows that lay on top of the Cascades main window intercept
 * the input events for the covered area using BPS events.
 *
 * @warning The current implementation has the following limitations:
 * - Setting the @c VisualNode::opacity attribute on this control or its parents have no effect on the 
 * control (However, @c VisualNode::visible does work, and can be used for hiding @c %ForeignWindowControl)
 *
 * - While @c %ForeignWindowControl can be arbitrarily transformed, the bound Screen window can only
 * be positioned as an axis-aligned rectangle. Applying transformations, such as
 * rotation or scaling, may result in rendering artifacts.
 *
 * Here's an example of how to create a Screen window and a @c %ForeignWindowControl in C++:
 * 
 * @code
