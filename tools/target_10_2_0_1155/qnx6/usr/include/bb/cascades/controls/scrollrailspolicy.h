     * (for example, a @c ScrollView).
     *
     * A rails policy specifies how scrolling behaves in response to a user's dragging gestures.
     * If scrolling is not locked to an axis, the control will scroll in any direction, emulating
     * the dragging movements of the user. Even if the user's intent is to scroll in a single
     * direction (i.e. vertically), slight movements along the horizontal axis will be reflected as well.
     *
     * If scrolling is locked, and a dragging gesture occurs roughly along a particular axis,
     * railing is enabled and scrolling becomes locked along that axis.
