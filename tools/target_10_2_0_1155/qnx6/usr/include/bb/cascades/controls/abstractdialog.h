    * @brief A base class for UI elements that represent full-screen view.
    *
    * The @c %AbstractDialog class is an abstract class that is used as a base for
    * UI elements that change the normal flow of an application. For example, in an
    * email application, adding a new contact could be considered a subtask that is
    * separate from the main flow of the application, and so could be implemented
    * using any of AbstractDialog's subclasses e.g. @c Sheet or @c Dialog.
    *
    * This class provides a way for subclasses to open or close the dialog using
    * corresponding @c open() and @c close() functions.
    *
    * The two concrete subclasses of this class are @c Sheet and @c Dialog.
    *
    * @see Sheet, Dialog
