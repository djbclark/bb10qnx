    * @brief A container that can be used for grouping controls and other containers.
    *
    * Children within a container are arranged according to the type of @c Layout assigned
    * to its @c #layout property. The default @c layout is @c StackLayout, which dictates that 
    * children are stacked in a column, from top to bottom. Other types of
    * layouts include @c DockLayout and @c AbsoluteLayout.    
    * 
    * When you add a control to a container, it is added as the last child in the container. 
    * If a container is removed from the scene, all of its children are removed as well.
    *
    * The size of the container behaves as follows:
    * - By default, the width and height are adjusted automatically to fit all the container's children.
    * - The width is adjustable using the @c Control::preferredWidth, @c Control::minWidth and @c Control::maxWidth properties.
    * - The height is adjustable using the @c Control::preferredHeight, @c Control::minHeight and @c Control::maxHeight and properties.
    *
    * @c %Container also has a @c #background property, which allows you to specify a @c Paint object 
    * which represents some sort of fill. The default fill for a container is fully transparent.
