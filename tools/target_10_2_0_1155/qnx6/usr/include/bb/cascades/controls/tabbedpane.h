        *
        * @brief A navigation control that allows the user to switch between tabs.
        *
        * The tabs can be used to either completely replace displayed content by
        * setting new panes or to filter existing content in a single pane based on
        * which tab is currently selected.
        *        
        * The @c %Tab objects in the @c %TabbedPane are added to the Action bar, which is a 
        * horizontal bar displayed at the bottom of the screen. The tabs on the Action bar 
        * can be pressed to switch to display their content. The @c %Tab objects take an 
        * @c %AbstractPane as their @c %content. If the content is not @c 0, it will be 
        * displayed in the @c %TabbedPane when the corresponding tab is selected.
        *
        * If the @c %TabbedPane has only one @c %Tab and the content of that @c %Tab has no
        * actions, the Action bar is not displayed since there aren't any additional tabs or 
        * actions to be displayed.
        *
        * The first added Tab becomes the active one.
        *
        * If the content of the @c %Tab that is being displayed has any @c %ActionItem objects 
        * associated with it, these actions take priority and are placed on the Action bar, while 
        * the other tabs are pushed to the side bar. This behavior can be changed by setting the 
        * @c showTabsOnActionBar property to @c true. If @c showTabsOnActionBar is @c true, tabs 
        * will be placed on the Action bar and actions will be placed in the Action menu.
        * 
        * The user can access tabs or actions that are not present on the Action bar by pressing 
        * the overflow tab, which is automatically added to the Action bar when it is needed.
        *
        * If a tab is selected that is not currently present on the Action bar, the side bar will
        * then change to the active-tab state and show the title and image of that tab 
        * along with an overflow symbol.
        *
        * It is possible for the application to programmatically change the appearance of the sidebar
        * by setting the property @c sidebarState.
        *
        * A tab can display a visual notification image if there is new content available.
        * If any tab that is only shown in the side bar contains such a visual notification,
        * the overflow tab will also display such a visual notification. This visual notification will remain on the
        * overflow tab until the corresponding tab(s) have been displayed (e.g. by opening the side bar) or the
        * visual notification is removed from all tabs that are only visible in the side bar and that had new content.
        *
        * Here's an example of a @c %TabbedPane with three tabs, each with its own page and set of actions.
        * The tabs are set to show on the Action bar so that the actions get pushed to the Action
        * menu.

        *
        * To get the actions displayed on the Action bar and the tabs in the Tab menu,
        * the @c showTabsOnActionBar property must be set to @c false and the
        * ActionBar.placement property for each action must be set to ActionBarPlacement.OnBar. Here's

        *
        * @code
