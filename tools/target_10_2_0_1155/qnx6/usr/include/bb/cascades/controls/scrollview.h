     * @brief A container class that enables scrolling and zooming of its content.
     *
     * Zooming and scrolling can either be done interactively by the user or programmatically by the
     * application.
     *
     * A @c %ScrollView shows a "viewport" into the the content being scrolled,
     * where only the content which fits into the current viewport will be
     * shown, the rest being clipped. If the content's dimensions are smaller
     * than the viewport then the content will be shown in its entirety.
     *
     * The dimensions of the @c %ScrollView specify the viewport's size (can be controlled
     * with @c VisualNode::preferredWidth, @c VisualNode::preferredHeight, @c VisualNode::minWidth,
     * and @c VisualNode::minHeight properties).
     *
     * The application can specify whether the @c %ScrollView is interactive,
     * and which directions the user can scroll by using @c ScrollViewProperties::scrollMode.
     *
     * Using a @c %ScrollView with horizontal scrolling in C++:
     *
     * @code
     * ScrollView* pMyScrollView = ScrollView::create(pMyContent)
     *     .scrollMode(ScrollMode::Horizontal);
     * @endcode
     *

     *         imageSource: "assets:///background.png"
