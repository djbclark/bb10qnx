     * @brief A control that indicates that a process is being completed.
     *
     * @image html activityindicator.png Example of what the activity indicator looks like
     *
     * The activity indicator is useful when the length of time for a particular process cannot
     * accurately be determined, or may take a long time.
     *
     * The activity indicator has three fixed graphics sizes. The size of the indicator and how it is positioned is determined according to the following input:
     * - The activity indicator will choose the largest of its three graphics sizes that fits inside the avaliable space.
     * - If the avaliable space is not exactly the right size the graphics will be centered in the avaliable space. The graphics will never be scaled.
     * - By default, it will not request a larger area than its smallest graphics size from the layout system.
     * - The control will try to respect preferred, min and max sizes if they are set by the user.
     *
     * Explanation of ActivityIndicator states/signals:
     * @code
     * start()     started                       stop()      stopped
     *   |------------|----------------------------|------------|
     *
     *   |----------------running------------------|--stopping--|
     * @endcode
     *
     * Here's an example of a simple activity indicator in QML:
