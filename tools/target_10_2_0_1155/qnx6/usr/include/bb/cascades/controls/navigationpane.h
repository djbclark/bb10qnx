        * @brief A class that is used for stack-like navigation between @c Page objects.
        * 
        * The @c %NavigationPane keeps track of a stack of @c %Page objects that can be
        * pushed and popped on the stack. Only the topmost page on the stack is displayed to the 
        * user. The @c push() function adds a new page on the top of the navigation stack, 
        * displaying it while hiding the old page. The @c pop() function hides 
        * the page currently on the top of the stack, removing it from the navigation stack and
        * displaying the previous page again.
        *
        * @image html navigation_pane_push_pop.png
        * 
        * The following example creates a @c %NavigationPane and adds a page. A second page
        * is created and added to the @c %NavigationPane when nextAction is triggered. The second 
        * page has a custom back button set through the @c NavigationPaneProperties class. The 
        * @c %NavigationPaneProperties class handles properties set to the @c %NavigationPane in order
        * to customize it.
        *
        * The default back button will have a standard back icon and the title "Back".
        *
        * @image html actionlist.png This is how the back button will look like by default.
        *
        * Here's an example of how to use @c %NavigationPane in QML:
        *
        * 
        * @code
        * // navigationpane.qml
        * 
        * NavigationPane {
        *     id: navigationPane
        *     Page {
        *         Container {
        *             Label { 
        *                 text: "First page" 
        *             }
        *         }
        *
        *         actions: [
        *             ActionItem {
        *                 title: "Next page"
        *                 ActionBar.placement: ActionBarPlacement.OnBar
        *                 onTriggered: {
        *                     var page = pageDefinition.createObject();
        *                     navigationPane.push(page);
        *                 }
        *
        *                 attachedObjects: ComponentDefinition {
        *                     id: pageDefinition;
        *                     source: "secondpage.qml"
        *                 }
        *             }
        *         ]
        *     }
        *     onPopTransitionEnded: { page.destroy(); }
        * }
        * @endcode
        *
        * @code
        * // secondpage.qml
        *
        * Page {
        *     Container {
        *         Label { 
        *             text: "Second page" 
        *         }
        *     }
        *     paneProperties: NavigationPaneProperties {
        *         backButton: ActionItem {
        *             title: "Previous page"
        *             imageSource: "asset:///back.png"
        *             onTriggered: { navigationPane.pop(); }
