     * @brief A class that exposes control over the networking layer of a @c WebPage.
     *
     * This interface is designed to be implemented and provided
     * by a consumer seeking advanced control over resource requests coming
     * from the @c WebPage.
     *
     * If an implementation of the class is instantiated and provided via
     * @c WebPage::setNetworkResourceRequestFilter(WebResourceRequestFilter*),
     * all resource requests can be intercepted in the following sequence:
     *
     * 1. @c filterResourceRequest() (and then if @c FilterAction is set to @c Filter, the following:)
     * 2. @c filterResourceOpened()
     * 3. @c filterResourceHeader() (once per HTTP Header)
     * 4. @c filterResourceData()
     * 5. @c filterResourceDone()
     *
     * @see @c WebView::setResourceRequestFilter()

         *
         * The life cycle of the provided @c WebResourceRequest object depends on the action taken.
         * @c Accept and @c Deny actions will result in the request being deleted immediately after the
         * @c filterResourceRequest() returns, unless the application developer has called @c setParent()
         * on the request. In that case, ownership is transferred to the application.
         *
         * In the @c Substitute case, an application developer should use @c setParent() to take ownership
         * of the request, and then call the following methods after the @c filterResourceRequest
         * returns to provide the data for the request.
         *
         * 1. request->notifyOpen()
         * 2. request->notifyHeaderReceived() // 0 or more times
         * 3. request->notifyDataReceived() // 0 or more times
         * 4. request->notifyDone()
         * 5. request->deleteLater() // Recommended method of cleanup.
         *
         * In the @c Filter case, the request's lifetime will continue until the @c filterNotifyDone() method
         * returns, at which point it will be deleted if @c setParent has not been called.
         *
         * In the @c Substitute and @c Filter cases the request and the @c WebPage can be independently deleted.
         * It is safe to call @c deleteLater() on the request when it is no longer needed as an optimization.
         * This includes destroying a request after, for example, a particular @c notifyHeaderReceived
         * occurs when the application no longer needs any more callbacks for this request.
         *

         *      Substitute - Call methods on the WebResourceRequest object to inject headers and data
         *      Filter     - Call back to this WebResourceRequestFilter and allow the implementation
         *                   to tweak the request on the fly. The following four methods will be called.
