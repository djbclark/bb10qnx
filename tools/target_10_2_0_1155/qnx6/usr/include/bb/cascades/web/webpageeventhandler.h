     * @brief A class that injects events into a @c WebPage.
     *
     * When rendering a @c WebPage using a @c WebPageCompositor in a custom OpenGL scene, you can
     * map screen events from the screen window coordinate system to the webpage content coordinate system depending
     * on how the page is projected onto the screen, and inject them using this API.
     *
     * This API can also be used to inject mouse and keyboard events.
     *
     * You can create events using @c createTouchEvent().
     *
     * This object can be created on any thread. However, the object has an affinity for the thread it was created on,
     * and may not be used on any other thread.
     *
     * @note Events are handled asynchronously, please refer to @c handleEvent(Event*) and @c eventHandled(Event*) for
     *       more detailed information.
     *
     * An example of multi-threaded use is as follows:
     *

     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/webpageeventhandler/src/screenthread.cpp webpageeventhandler2

     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/webpageeventhandler/src/main.cpp webpageeventhandler5
     *
     * @c WebPageCompositor is normally used from C++, but here is an example of using @c WebPageCompositor in QML:
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/webpageeventhandlerqml/assets/main.qml webpageeventhandlerqml_qml1
     *
     * Add the following lines to the C++ main program to register @c WebPageCompositor:

         *
         * @c TouchType::Cancel events are used in situations where an @c Up event will never come, for example
         * when the app decides to stop sending events for an ongoing touch interaction and instead handle the rest of
         * the sequence without any involvement of the webpage.
         *
         * An example can clarify this. Consider a scenario where touch events are used to interact with the
         * webpage, but also used to scroll the webpage.
         * A touch move should first be sent to @c handleEvent(Event*), and the caller should wait for
         * @c eventHandled() signal to be emitted. If the finger moves a certain distance from the touch down point,
         * the app may want to start scrolling instead. The webpage will expect the sequence to complete, and a
         * @c Cancel event should be injected to accomplish that.
