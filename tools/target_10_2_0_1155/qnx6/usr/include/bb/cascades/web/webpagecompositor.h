    /*!
     * @brief A class that composites the internal scene graph of a @c WebPage.
     *
     * The scene graph must be composited to a render target. Currently, an OpenGL texture can be used as the target.
     * The texture can then be used in custom OpenGL rendering code to render the webpage as part of an OpenGL scene.
     * See WebPageTexture for more information.
     *
     * In addition to the web content, injected user input events may cause the webpage to have overlays. These
     * include selection handles, fine cursor control handles, and other overlays. These can optionally be included in
     * the output of the @c WebPageCompositor.
     *
     * All operations on a @c WebPageCompositor are asynchronous, including rendering.
     *
     * The @c WebPageCompositor API is very similar to that of @c ScrollView. Since it is a @c Control,
     * the @c ScrollView has a size that it can use as a basis for @c contentScale and @c viewableArea calculations. The
     * @c WebPageCompositor is not part of a layout system that adjusts its size like controls do, instead it has a
     * viewport size that is set directly using @c setViewportSize(). The viewport size is used as a basis for
     * @c contentScale and @c viewableArea calculations, and is typically set to the same size as the @c WebPageTexture used as
     * the render target.
     *
     * The viewable area of the page can be composited to a texture by calling @c renderToTexture(). If you want
     * to include overlays in the rendering output, call @c renderToTexture(). Use @c scrollToPoint(), @c zoomToPoint(), and
     * @c zoomToRect() to manage the viewable area.
     *
     * When the webpage appearance changes, @c repaintRequested() is emitted. In a connected slot, the app should
     * call @c renderToTexture(). When rendering is done, the texture emits the @c WebPageTexture::textureChanged()
     * signal, which indicates that the texture is ready to be rendered using custom OpenGL code.
     *
     * An instance of @c WebPageEventHandler can be used to inject input events to the webpage, and
     * thus allow interaction with the web content. As a result of interaction, the webpage may request scrolling or
     * zooming to take place by emitting @c scrollRequested() and @c zoomRequested(). The app can animate these
     * transitions, or simply call @c scrollToPoint() or @c zoomToPoint() directly.
     *
     * This object can be created on any thread. However, the object has an affinity for the thread it was created on,
     * and may not be used on any other thread.
     *
     * @see @c WebPage, which represents a webpage that can be composited by this class.
     * @see @c WebPageTexture, which represents a texture that can be used as a render target when
     *      compositing.
     * @see @c WebPageEventHandler, which can be used to inject user input events to the webpage.
     *
     * Example of multi-threaded use:
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/webpagecompositor/src/mythread.h webpagecompositor1
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/webpagecompositor/src/mythread.cpp webpagecompositor2
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/webpagecompositor/src/main.cpp webpagecompositor3
     *
     * @c WebPageCompositor is normally used from C++, but here is an example of using @c WebPageCompositor in QML:
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/webpagecompositorqml/assets/main.qml webpagecompositorqml_qml1
     *
     * Add the following lines to the C++ main program to register @c WebPageCompositor:
     *
     * @snippet tad/examples/controls/webpagecompositorqml/src/webpagecompositorqml.cpp webpagecompositorqml1
     *
     * @xmlonly
     * <apigrouping group="User interface/Web"/>
