    /*!
     * @brief A visual node in the scene graph.
     *
     * @details The position of a @c %VisualNode in the scene graph is determined by two forms of input:
     * the @c Control::layoutProperties set on the node, and 
     * the type of @c Layout of its parent node. In addition, extra transforms (translation, 
     * rotation, and scale) can be applied to offset the visual node from its layout placement.
     * When rotating or scaling a node, the @c pivotX and @c pivotY properties can be used
     * to change the anchoring point for the transition. The default pivot point for a visual
     * node is (0,0), which represents the center of the node.
     *
     * In addition to managing the transforms of a node, @c %VisualNode also contains
     * an @c opacity property for changing its transparency, and a 
     * @c visible property for specifying whether the visual node should be laid out in the scene.
     * Setting the @c visible value to @c false is not the same as setting @c opacity to 
     * @c 0.0f (fully transparent).
     * While the transparent node is still positioned by the layout and takes up room in the
     * scene, a node that is not @c visible will not be rendered or positioned inside the scene.
     *
     * Setting @c visible to @c false essentially removes the node from the scene without unlinking it from the
     * scene graph. In this state, no touch events will be sent to the node. This 
     * is a convenient way of removing nodes to optimize the performance of the scene without 
     * actually unlinking them. It is highly recommended to use this property to hide visual 
     * nodes whenever possible.
     *
     * 
     * <h2>Animating visual properties</h2>
     *
     * For most of the visual properties of a @c %VisualNode (translation, rotation, scale, and opacity),
     * changing the value at runtime initiates a default implicit animation. For example,
     * if the @c opacity property of a node is changed from 1.0 to 0.0, instead of becoming instantly transparent,
     * the visuals are animated gradually (but, the actual property value is changed right away).
     *
     * If implicit animations are not enough, a set of explicit animations can be added
     * to a visual node (using @c VisualNode:animations) for animating its properties or the
     * properties of the derived class:
     *
     * - @c FadeTransition: animates the @c opacity property
     * - @c RotateTransition: animates the @c rotationZ property
     * - @c ScaleTransition: animates the @c scaleX and @c scaleY properties
     * - @c TranslateTranstion: animates the @c translationX and @c translationY properties
     *
     * <h2>Touch events</h2>
     *
     * The visual node receives touch events through two signals: touch() and touchCapture().
     * The first one receives events delivered in the PropagationPhase::AtTarget and
     * PropagationPhase::Bubble phases, the second one receives events in the
     * PropagationPhase::Capturing phase.
