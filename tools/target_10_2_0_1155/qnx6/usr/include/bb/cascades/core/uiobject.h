         * @brief A hierarchical list of the UIObject's attached objects.
         *
         * This QDeclarativeListProperty can contain any QObject. When a QObject is added
         * to property, the UIObject takes ownership of the attached object. 
         *
         * This feature is typically used from QML to specify business logic
         * object or any other shared objects for the subnodes of this UIObject. 
         * In C++ the same functionality can be achived by setting a parent
         * of a QObject to be attached to the QObject which is going to own it. 
         *
         * QML usage example (MyObject is a custom class registered 
         * for QML using the @c qmlRegisterType() function):
         *
         * @code
         * Container {
         *     Label { text: "Title: " + myObject.title } 
         *     Label { text: "Subject: " + myObject.subject }
         *     attachedObjects: [
         *         MyObject { id: myObject
         *             title: "Hello World"
         *             subject: "Nice Day"
         *         }
         *     ]
