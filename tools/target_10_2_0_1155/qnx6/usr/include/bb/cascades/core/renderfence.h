/*!
 * @brief Provides a way to get notified when current changes to the scene
 * associated with particular window have been rendered.
 *
 * @details Fence can be used to ensure the window content has been updated before the
 * application issues "cardReady" reply to @c %InvokeManager for example, or
 * to find out when the set scene has been rendered.
 *
 * When created the fence is in @c RenderFenceState::Created state. From this
 * state it can change to the following end states:
 * - @c RenderFenceState::NotReached : fence becomes NotReached when it was
 *   raised but hasn't yet been @c Reached, @c Aborted or @c TimedOut
 * - @c RenderFenceState::Reached : fence becomes Reached at some point after the changes
 *   made to the scene after it was Raised are rendered and presented. The timing of this state change
 *   is not guaranteed, the only thing that is guaranteed that it the fence will change
 *   the state at some point after the rendering has completed.
 * - @c RenderFenceState::Aborted : if the @c raised property was set to false while
 *   in NotReached state, or if for some reason the fence can not be reached, for
 *   example rendering has been halted due to window or application state change such as
 *   window being minimized, card pooled and so on.
 * - @c RenderFenceState::TimedOut : when the fence was not reached or aborted within 3
 *   seconds.
 *
 * By default the fence is created for the main window (@see Application::mainWindow).
 *
 * The render fence must be raised before it can be reached, which can be done by setting 
 * the @c raised property to @c true.
 * The fence can be re-used by setting the @c raised property to @c true again after it has reached 
 * any of the ending states (RenderFenceState::Reached, RenderFenceState::Aborted,
 * RenderFenceState::TimedOut).
 *
 * The fence can also be explicitly aborted by setting the @c raised property to @c false.
 *
 * @warning Due to backwards compatibility reasons there is one exception when the fence
 * doesn't have to be explicitly raised after creation:
 * if it is created using builder and the builder has been assigned to a variable. In this
 * case the fence will be raised automatically (@c raised property will be set to @c true):
 * @code
 * // Created using constructor, not raised.
 * RenderFence *fence = new RenderFence();
 * // Created with builder but not assigned or explicitly raised(), not raised.
 * RenderFence::create();
 * 
 * // Created with builder and assigned: the following fence WILL be raised.
 * RenderFence *raisedFence = RenderFence::create();
 *
 * // To prevent assigned fence from being raised set raised to @c false.
 * RenderFence *raisedFence = RenderFence::create().raised(false);
 * @endcode
 *
 * An example of creating a render fence and connecting application's slots to its signals.
 * The fence will change its state when the scene has been rendered and presented, and
 * it will automatically delete itself once any of the signals are emitted:
 * @code
 * myScene = //... Create the scene.
 * Application::instance()->setScene(myScene);
 * 
 * RenderFence::create()
 *     .parent(myApplication)
 *     .onReached(myApplication, SLOT(handleReached()))
 *     .onTimedOut(myApplication, SLOT(handleTimedOut()))
 *     .onAborted(myApplication, SLOT(handleAborted()))
 *     .autoDeleted()
 *     .raised(true);
 * @endcode
 *
 * An example of using the fence from QML:
 * @code
 * Button {
 *     text: "Change Button Opacity"
 *     enabled: !fence.raised
 *     onClicked: {
 *         opacity = opacity * 0.9
 *         fence.raised = true
 *     }
 *     attachedObjects: [
 *         RenderFence {
 *             id: fence
 *         }
 *     ]
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @xmlonly
 *     <apigrouping group="User interface/Application structure"/>
