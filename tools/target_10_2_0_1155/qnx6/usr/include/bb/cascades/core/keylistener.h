       /*!  
        * @brief Enables controls to be notified on key events that are introduced by user interaction
        * with the keyboard.        
        *
        * A key listener can be attached to objects that inherit from @c Control and @c AbstractPane classes.
        * Please note that the key events propagate from the control in focus up to the root of the scene.
        * In case no control is currently in focus, all key events are redirected to the root.                
        *
        * A key listener has 3 signals @c keyEvent, @c keyPressed and @c keyReleased. The @c %keyEvent signal is emitted every
        * time a key event arrives at the control. The @c %keyPressed is only emitted in case of a key 
        * press event. Similarly, the @c %keyReleased signal is only emitted as a key relese event arrives at a control
        *
        * Here's how to create an @c %KeyListener and add it to a @c %Control. 
        
        * @code
        * KeyListener* myKeyListener = KeyListener::create()
        *     .onKeyEvent(this, SLOT
        *               (onKeyEventHandler(bb::cascades::KeyEvent *)))
        *     .onKeyPressed(this, SLOT
        *               (onKeyPressedHandler(bb::cascades::KeyEvent *)))
        *     .onKeyReleased(this, SLOT
        *               (onKeyReleasedHandler(bb::cascades::KeyEvent *)));
        *
        * Page* myPage = Page::create();
        * myPage->addKeyListener(myKeyListener);
        * @endcode
        *
        * Here's another example of how to create a @c %KeyListener, this time by calling the constructor
        * and connecting it to each signal individually.
        * @code
        * KeyListener* myKeyListener = new KeyListener();
        * QObject::connect(myKeyListener, SIGNAL(keyEvent(bb::cascades::KeyEvent*)),
        *                    this, SLOT(onKeyEventHandler(KeyEvent *)));
        * QObject::connect(myKeyListener, SIGNAL(keyPressed(bb::cascades::KeyEvent*)),
        *                    this, SLOT(onKeyPressedHandler(KeyEvent *)));
        * QObject::connect(myKeyListener, SIGNAL(keyReleased(bb::cascades::KeyEvent*)),
        *                    this, SLOT(onKeyReleasedHandler(KeyEvent *)));
        *
        * Control* myControl = Control::create();
        * myControl->addKeyListener(myKeyListener);
        * @endcode
        *
        * And here's how to create a key listener for a @c %Control using QML:
        * @code
        * Control {
        *     keyListeners: [
        *         KeyListener {
        *             onKeyEvent: {                      
        *             }
        *             
        *             onKeyPressed: {                      
        *             }
        *
        *             onKeyReleased: {                      
        *             }        
        *         }
        *     ]
        * }
        * @endcode
        *
        * @xmlonly
        *     <apigrouping group="User interface/Events"/>
        * @endxmlonly
        *
