     * @brief An abstract class that can be used to provide a @c ListView with data.
     *
     * Any data that can be contained in a @c QVariant can be provided to the @c %ListView.
     * Typical examples of @c QVariant content are @c QString, @c QVariantMap and @c QObject*.
     * The data can also be an empty @c %QVariant for each item, if the @c %ListView has a
     * @c ListItemProvider with access to all relevant data.
     *
     * When a @c %DataModel implementation is attached to a @c %ListView, the @c %ListView will call the
     * @c %DataModel implementation when model data is needed and will listen to the various signals
     * emitted from the @c %DataModel implementation. @c %ListView takes ownership
     * of any @c %QObject* (wrapped in @c %QVariant) returned by @c data(), if the returned object
     * doesn't already have a parent.
     *
     * A single @c %DataModel can be connected to any number of @c %ListView objects. @c %ListView has
     * a property @c ListView::rootIndexPath that allows it to choose which node in the @c %DataModel
     * to use as the root node.
     *
     * <h2>Index paths</h2>
     *
     * Index paths are used for identifying items in @c %ListView, @c %DataModel
     * and all related classes. In C++ an index path is a @c QVariantList
     * object containing a number of @c QVariant integers, one for each ancestor (including the root
     * item) of the specified item. The reason for index paths being @c %QVariantList
     * objects in C++ is that @c %QVariantList objects are the C++ equivalent of QML JavaScript arrays.
     * So in QML an index path is simply an array containing integers.
     * For an item that is a direct child of the root item,
     * the index path contains a single integer. A child of that item would instead have
     * an index path consisting of two integers, and so on.
     *
     * Examples of index paths:
     *
     * - [3] - index path for the fourth child of the root item
     * - [3,0] - index path for the first child of the fourth child of the root item
     * - [] - index path for the root item (an empty array)
     *
     * Example of accessing indexes from index paths in C++:
     *
     * - indexPath[0].toInt() - gets the top level index from this index path
     * - indexPath[1].toInt() - gets the second level index from this index path (if the index
     * path contains that many levels)
     *
     * See @ref index_paths for more information.
