/*!
 * @brief An animation that controls the position of a @c VisualNode.
 *
 * The translation properties of a node are specified by @c VisualNode::translationX and
 * @c VisualNode::translationY. When translating a node along its x or y
 * axis, the layout of the node is not affected, just it's positioning
 * on the screen. The translation properties correspond with actual pixel amounts. 
 *
 * You can reposition a visual node using @c from and @c to values for
 * the x and y axes (@c fromX/toX for moving horizontally and @c fromY/toY for moving vertically).
 * The @c from and @c to values
 * are always relative to the node's current position on the screen. So, if the node is
 * in the center of the screen, you would specify a negative @c toX value to move
 * the node horizontally to the right. 
 * The duration of the animation and the easing curve are specified by the @c AbstractTransition::duration
 * and @c AbstractTransition::easingCurve properties, respectively.
 *
 * When both from and to properties are specified, the transition will run
 * as normal in the specified duration, using the specified easing curve.
 *
 * If only the @c from property is specified, the transition will run from the
 * value specified by @c from to the value of the @c VisualNode::translationX or
 * @c VisualNode::translationY property at the time the animation was started.
 *
 * If only the @c to property is specified, the transition will run from the
 * current value of the @c VisualNode::translationX or
 * @c VisualNode::translationY property at the time animation started
 * to the @c to value specified by property.
 *
 * By not specifying a @c to or @c from property, the actual value remains undefined. So, you
 * should not attempt to read the value unless the corresponding @c isSet function is set to @c true
 * (for example, @c isToXSet()).
 *
 * While a property is being animated, its value does not change.
 * It's only when the animation is completed that the animated property is updated with
 * a new value. If you need access to the intermediate values for an animated property, you can 
 * be notified of changes through the @c VisualNode::translationXChanging or @c VisualNode::translationYChanging
 * signals. However, because of the frequency that
 * these signals are triggered, performance issues can arise, so they should only be used when absolutely necessary.
 *
 * Once an animation is playing, changing its properties will not have an effect
 * until the next time animation is started.
 *
 * Here's how to animate the repositioning of a button, along its x axis
 * from 10 to 100 pixels in 1000 milliseconds.
 *
 * @snippet tad/examples/animation/translatetransition/src/TranslateTransExamples.cpp translatetransition_button
 *
 * This example shows how to animate the position
 * of a button vertically from its current value to 100 using the StockCurve::CubicIn curve.
 * Once the transition is complete it is auto-deleted.
 *
 * @snippet tad/examples/animation/translatetransition/src/TranslateTransExamples.cpp translatetransition_stockcurve
 *
 * In QML, you add animations to a control's animations list, which represents
 * all of the animations that apply to the control. When you want to start the 
 * animation, you simply call its play() function. Here's how to create a button that,
 * when clicked, moves 500 pixels along its x axis over 3 seconds.
