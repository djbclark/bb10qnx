    /*!
     * @brief A set of defined easing curves used for animating properties.
     *
     * Easing curves are functions that specify the speed of an animation.
     * You can use them to make animations look more realistic without requiring you to do physics calculations.
     * For example, when you animate a dropping ball, you want the ball to speed up as it drops.
     * An easing curve that eases out would create that effect.
     *
     * An easing curve is defined by two parameters: an interpolator function, 
     * and a type of curve that describes the velocity of the transition 
     * (how quickly it accelerates and decelerates at the beginning and the end of the animation).
     *
     * The velocity easing curve types are:
     * - easing In: animation is fast at the beginning, slow at the end.
     * - easing Out: animation is slow at the beginning, fast at the end.
     * - easing InOut: animation is slow at the beginning, fast in the middle, slow at the end.
     *
     * Not all easing curves are appropriate for every situation. For example,
     * @c Linear curve looks unnatural for most types of movement, but works well when changing
     * opacity. @c QuarticOut is similar to the default implicit animation used for core controls;
     * it works well with user-initiated animations since it's responsive and smooth at the same time.
     *
