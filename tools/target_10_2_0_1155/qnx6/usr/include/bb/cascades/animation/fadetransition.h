/*!
 * 
 * @brief An animation that controls the opacity of a @c VisualNode.
 *
 * The opacity property of a node is specified by the @c VisualNode::opacity property.
 * How the opacity changes is determined by the @c fromOpacity and @c toOpacity values that are specified
 * in the transition.
 * By default, a visual node's opacity is 1.0, meaning that it is fully opaque. A value of 0.0
 * indicates that the node is fully transparent.
 * The duration of the animation and the easing curve are specified by the @c AbstractTransition::duration
 * and @c AbstractTransition::easingCurve properties, respectively.
 *
 * When both the @c from and @c to properties are specified, the transition will run as
 * normal in the specified duration, using the specified easing curve.
 *
 * If only the @c from property is specified, the transition will run from the
 * @c from value specified to the current value of the @c %VisualNode::opacity property at the
 * time the animation started. 
 *
 * If only the @c to property is specified, the transition will run from the
 * current value of the @c %VisualNode::opacity property at the time animation started
 * to the @c to value specified by property.
 *
 * By not specifying a @c to or @c from property, the actual value remains undefined. So, you
 * should not attempt to read the value unless the corresponding @c isSet function is set to @c true
 * (for example, @c isToOpacitySet()).
 *
 * While a property is being animated, its value does not change.
 * It's only when the animation is completed that the animated property is updated with
 * a new value. If you need access to the intermediate values for an animated property, you can 
 * be notified of changes through the @c VisualNode::opacityChanging() signal.
 * However, because of the frequency that
 * these signals are triggered, performance issues can arise, so they should only be used when absolutely necessary.
 *
 * Once an animation is playing, changing its properties will not have an effect
 * until the next time animation is started.
 *
 * Here's an example of how you can animate the opacity property
 * of a button, from 0 to 1 in 1000 milliseconds:
 *
 * @snippet tad/examples/animation/fadetransition/src/FadeTransitionExamples.cpp fadetransition_button
 *
 * This examples shows how you can animate the opacity property
 * of the button from its current value to 0 using the StockCurve::CubicIn curve.
 * Once the transition is complete it is auto-deleted.
 *
 * @snippet tad/examples/animation/fadetransition/src/FadeTransitionExamples.cpp fadetransition_stockcurve
 * 
 * And here is how you can create a %FadeTransition in QML:
 *
 * @snippet tad/examples/animation/fadetransition/assets/main.qml fadetransition_button_qml
 *
 * @see VisualNode::opacity, VisualNode::opacityChanging, AbstractTransition
