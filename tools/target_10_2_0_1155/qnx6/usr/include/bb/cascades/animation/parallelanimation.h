/*!
 * 
 * @brief A group animation that plays its children animations in parallel.
 * 
 * Children animations can be added to the animation using the builder model.
 *
 * When the animations' @c AbstractAnimation::play() method is called the 
 * children animations will be played in parallel.
 * 
 * Setting an explicit target via the @c AbstractAnimation::target property
 * will set implicit targets for its children animations automatically.
 * This allows you to specify a target only for the root of the animation
 * tree.
 *
 * Children animations of a @c %ParallelAnimation will not have
 * their states updated while an animation is playing.
 * AbstractAnimation functions such as @c isPlaying(), @c isStopped(), @c isEnded()
 * can not be used on children animations since their return values will
 * not accurately represent the current state of the animation.
 * Only the root animation in the animation tree will contain accurate states
 * and will have corresponding lifecycle signals emitted.
 * 
 * This example shows how to use a parallel animation to run a fade transition
 * and a translate transition on a @c Button, simultaneously.
 * The button is translated along its x-axis from @c 0 to @c 100 and is faded out
 * at the same time.
 * Since the target node (pButton) is specified as the root of the animation tree, the
 * @c %SequentialAnimation and its children animations will target the same node (it becomes
 * the children's implicit target).
