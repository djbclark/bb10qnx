 * Animations represent a change, over time, of a property or set of properties according to specified rules.
 * Each animation that inherits this class has a @c #target property (the node that the animation changes), 
 * a @c #delay property (the time between initiation and when the animation actually starts) 
 * and a @c #repeatCount property (the number of times the animation is repeated).
 *
 * Once an animation is playing, changing its properties will not take effect
 * until the next time animation is re-started (either stopped and started, or ended

    * @brief The target for the animation.
    * 
    * Even if a target is not explicitly set, the animation
    * can have an implicit target in the following instances:
    *
    * - If the animation is a child of a @c VisualNode object, the parent is assumed to be the 
    *   animation's implicit target
    * - If the animation is a child of a @c GroupAnimation object, the @c GroupAnimation
    *   object's target is assumed to be the animation's implicit target 
    *
    * If an animation has children, setting the explicit target for the animation causes the children's
    * implicit targets to change accordingly.
    *
    * When the target node is explicitly set on the animation, the node it is attached to 
    * does not take ownership, meaning that if the target node is destroyed, the animation 
    * is not removed with it. To help manage the animation lifecycle, the ownership of an 
    * animation can assigned to a @c VisualNode by calling @c VisualNode::addAnimation(). 
    * This can help ensure that the animation's memory is cleaned up properly.
    *
    * Once an animation is playing, changing its properties will not take effect
    * until the next time animation is started.
    *
    * The default value of this property is @c 0.
