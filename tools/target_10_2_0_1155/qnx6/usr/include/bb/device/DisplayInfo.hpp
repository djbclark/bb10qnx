 *
 *
 * @brief The @c DisplayInfo API enables applications to determine properties of the 
 *        built-in physical displays, and any externally connected physical displays. 
 *        These properties include the display size and resolution, the ID and name, 
 *        and the aspect and attached state.
 *
 * @details Two physical displays are explicitly recognized: A primary, built-in 
 *          display and a secondary, externally connected display.
 *          Other internal or external displays that may exist are also supported by
 *          this API but only if their screen display IDs are known. An external 
 *          display can be thought of as a display port on the device. The port may 
 *          or may not have a physical display attached to it at any given time. The
 *          @c DisplayInfo class not only facilitates accessing display parameters 
 *          but also enables monitoring the display state, such as when a physical 
 *          display is attached or disconnected (@c attachedChanged()).
 *
 * @note A @c DisplayInfo instance should not be moved to another thread, and must be
 *       deleted on the thread in which it was created.
 *
 * If only the primary display is of interest, instantiate a @c DisplayInfo object 
 * and query it for parameters:
 * @code
    bb::device::DisplayInfo display;
    qDebug() << "display id is " << display.displayId();
    qDebug() << "display name is " << display.displayName();
    qDebug() << "display size is " << display.pixelSize().width() << ", " 
             << display.pixelSize().height();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The following example shows how to monitor the secondary display:
 * @code
    int secondaryDisplayId = bb::device::DisplayInfo::secondaryDisplayId();
    qDebug() << "secondary display Id is " << secondaryDisplayId;
    
    // Construct the DisplayInfo object for the secondary display, and set its parent 
    // to some "mainApp" so it will take care of the destruction.
    bb::device::DisplayInfo* secondaryDisplayInfo = new bb::device::DisplayInfo(secondaryDisplayId, &mainApp);

    // The display parameters are interesting if a physical display is attached.
    if ( secondaryDisplayInfo->isAttached() ) {
        qDebug() << "secondary display name is " 
                 << secondaryDisplayInfo->displayName();
        qDebug() << "secondary display size is " 
                 << secondaryDisplayInfo->pixelSize().width() 
                 << ", " << secondaryDisplayInfo->pixelSize().height();
    }

    // Connect the "mainApp's" slot to the secondary display's attachedChanged() 
    // signal in order to be notified when the attached state changes.
    QObject::connect(secondaryDisplayInfo, SIGNAL(attachedChanged(bool)), 
                     &mainApp, SLOT(secondaryDisplayAttachedChanged(bool)));
