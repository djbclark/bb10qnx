 *
 * @brief Represents a logical network connection for a cellular data service. 
 *
 * @details A carrier may route traffic for different cellular data services over 
 * different network interfaces. Furthermore, different carriers may route traffic 
 * for the same service over different network interfaces. @c CellularDataInterface
 * maps the logical name of a cellular data service to its carrier-dependent network 
 * interface, provides information about the service's network connection, and 
 * allows the activation/de-activation of on-demand connections.
 *
 * Use @c allNames() to discover the set of cellular data services configured 
 * for this device. Possible logical names include:
 *
 * - @c a_gps - Connection for Assisted Global Positioning (A-GPS)
 * - @c bip - Connection for Bearer Independent Protocol (BIP) - see 3gpp TS 31.111 and 3gpp TS 27.007
 * - @c bip_2 - Alternate connection for BIP
 * - @c bip_3 - Alternate connection for BIP
 * - @c bip_4 - Alternate connection for BIP
 * - @c bip_5 - Alternate connection for BIP
 * - @c blackberry - Connection for BlackBerry services
 * - @c carrier_800 - Connection for carrier applications
 * - @c carrier_admin - Connection for carrier administrative applications
 * - @c carrier_apps - Connection for carrier applications
 * - @c ims - Connection for IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)
 * - @c internet - Connection for cellular Internet access
 * - @c mms - Connection for Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)
 * - @c plan_admin - Connection for adminstration of user's cellular service plan
 * - @c rim_admin - Connection for administrative BlackBerry services
 * - @c software_update - Connection for downloading software updates
 * - @c streaming - Connection for alternate streaming channels
 * - @c tethering - Connection for tethering applications
 * - @c tethering_2 - Alternate connection for tethering applications
 * - @c tethering_entitlement - Connection for tethering entitlement check
 * - @c tethering_user - Connection for tethering applications with user supplied configuration
 * - @c vvm - Connection for Visual Voicemail (VVM)
 * - @c wap - Connection for Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)
 *
 * The following cellular data services support activation/de-activation of on-demand 
 * connections via @c requestConnect() and @c requestDisconnect():
 *
 * - @c carrier_800 - Requires @c cds_carrier_800 permission
 * - @c carrier_admin - Requires @c cds_carrier_admin permission
 * - @c carrier_apps - Requires @c cds_carrier_apps permission
 * - @c plan_admin - Requires @c cds_plan_admin permission
 *
 * Most applications that need to send/receive data over a network connection should
 * not bind to a specific network interface. Instead, these applications should 
 * accept the default route for their traffic. Even binding to the network interface
 * for @c internet is not recommended as this is a cellular-only connection and does 
 * not account for the availability of a WiFi connection.
 *
 * Applications that have a specific need to send/receive data using a particular 
 * cellular data service can do so using the following steps:
 *
 * -# Create an instance of @c CellularDataInterface using the logical name of your service.
 * -# Call @c isValid() to verify the logical name is correct and supported.
 * -# Call @c requestConnect() and check the return value for an error.
 * -# Wait for the @c connectionState property to become @c CellularConnectionState::Connected.
 * -# Query the @c networkInterfaceName property to get the service's network interface.
 * -# Set the @c SOCK_SO_BINDTODEVICE environment variable to the service's network interface; all subsequently created sockets will be bound to this network interface.
 * -# Send/receive data.
 * -# Call @c requestDisconnect().
 *
 * It is important to always call @c requestConnect() and @c requestDisconnect() 
 * regardless of the current connection state. The OS determines when to 
 * activate/de-activate an on-demand connection for a cellular data service based on 
 * the calls to @c requestConnect() and @c requestDisconnect(). When multiple
 * applications use the same service, the OS keeps the connection active until the
 * last application calls @c requestDisconnect(). Using a service without first 
 * calling @c requestConnect() means there is no guarantee the connection will
 * remain active while you're using it.
 *
 * Furthermore, you must keep the @c CellularDataInterface object alive until you're 
 * done sending/receiving data. The destructor for @c CellularDataInterface 
 * implicitly calls @c requestDisconnect().
