 * @brief Allows monitoring of network traffic statistics.
 *
 * @details The @c NetworkDataUsage classes measures the amount of data (in 
 * packets or bytes) sent or received by a particular network interface since
 * the device was last reset. To determine the name of a valid network interface 
 * for use with this class, use the @c QNetworkInterface::allInterfaces() and 
 * @c QNetworkInterface::humanReadableName() methods.
 
 * The traffics statistics reported by @c NetworkDataUsage are not live. You 
 * must call @c update() to obtain the latest packet/byte counts. To montior 
 * network usage over time, you can attach the @c update() slot to the @c timeout 
 * signal of a @c QTimer. However, be aware that polling can prevent the device 
 * from entering a low power state, which adversely affects battery life. If you 
 * must poll, please use the lowest frequency possible and suspend polling 
 * whenever possible.
