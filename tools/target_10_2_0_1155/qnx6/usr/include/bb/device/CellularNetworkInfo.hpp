 *
 * @brief Encapsulates the capabilities and state of a connected cellular network.
 *
 * @details The @c CellularNetworkInfo class represents a single network that the cellular 
 * radio is connected to. The radio may be connected to multiple networks simultaneously. 
 * This can occur when using @c CellularTechnology::Cdma1X. The first connected network 
 * (@c CellularTechnology::Evdo or @c CellularTechnology::Lte) will provide data service 
 * and the second network (@c CellularTechnology::Cdma1X) will provide voice service. In 
 * most other cases, only a single network will be connected. Use 
 * @c CellularRadioInfo::networkCount() to determine the total number of connected 
 * networks and @c setIndex() to associate a @c CellularNetworkInfo object with one of 
 * those networks. If no network exists for the current index, all properties report 
 * empty/zero values.
 *
 * The @c CellularNetworkInfo class provides information about which wireless 
 * communication standard and voice/data services the network supports (see @c technology() 
 * and @c services() respectively). It also provides details about the network's identity
 * (see @c name(), @c mobileCountryCode(), and @c mobileNetworkCode()) and radio signal
 * strength (see @c signalStrength()). Use @c isRoaming() to distinguish between a visited
 * network and the user's home network.
 *
 * Location information may be derived using the identity of the base station providing 
 * service for the network. For GSM/UMTS networks, see @c cellId() and 
 * @c locationAreaCode(). For LTE networks, see @c cellId() and @c trackingAreaCode(). For 
 * CDMA networks, see @c baseStationId(), @c networkId(), and @c systemId().
