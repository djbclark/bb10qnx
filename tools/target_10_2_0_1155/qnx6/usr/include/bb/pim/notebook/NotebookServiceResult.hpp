 * @brief The @c NotebookServiceResult class provides status codes that are returned from add, update, and delete
 * functions in @c NotebookService.
 *
 * @details After invoking an add, update, or delete function in the @c %NotebookService class, you should first
 * compare its status code to @c NotebookServiceResult::Success to determine whether it succeeded (in which case the
 * appropriate signal will be emitted).  If the function did not succeed, you can determine the granularity
 * of the error-handling that you want to perform by comparing against the possible error statuses documented in the
 * function being invoked.
