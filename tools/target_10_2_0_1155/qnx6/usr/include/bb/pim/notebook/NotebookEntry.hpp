 *
 * @brief The @c NotebookEntry class represents an entry that is contained within a @c Notebook.
 *
 * @details A @c %NotebookEntry is a single "thought" or "action" that a user wants to track. Each
 * @c %NotebookEntry is contained by exactly one @c %Notebook, allowing them to be grouped together as
 * the user sees fit.
 *
 * Each @c %NotebookEntry has a status. It can be non-actionable (a "thought" that doesn't require
 * any action on the part of the user) or actionable (an "action" the user intends to take by a
 * certain date and time). Actionable @c %NotebookEntry objects are either completed or not completed.
 * For more information, see the @c NotebookEntryStatus::Type enumeration. Actionable @c %NotebookEntry
 * objects can have a due date and/or a reminder.
 *
 * A @c %NotebookEntry can be augmented with attachments, which are displayed within the Remember application,
 * leading to a richer user experience. See the @c NotebookEntryAttachment class for information on what attachment
 * MIME types are supported natively by the Remember application.  You can add attachments with
 * arbitrary MIME types to be handled by their own applications, but the Remember application will ignore
 * MIME types that it does not recognize.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *   // Here's how to create an actionable NotebookEntry with a title and due date,
 *   // and add it to the default Notebook.  Note that service objects are
 *   // potentially expensive to initialize, so you should not create them on a
 *   // per-use basis as is done below.
 *   NotebookService service;
 *   NotebookEntry entry;
 *   entry.setTitle( "New NotebookEntry" );
 *   entry.setStatus( NotebookEntryStatus::NotCompleted );
 *   entry.setDueDateTime( QDateTime::currentDateTime().addDays( 1 ) );
 *   NotebookId notebookId = service.defaultNotebook().id();
 * 
 *   // You should be sure to check the return code from addNotebookEntry() for
 *   // success
 *   service.addNotebookEntry( &entry, notebookId );
