 *
 * @brief The @c NotebookService class provides CRUD (create/read/update/delete) operations on @c Notebook objects
 * and their @c NotebookEntry objects.
 *
 * @details @c %NotebookService is domain-level API that abstracts away all persistence details.  Clients of this
 * API need only deal with @c %Notebook and @c %NotebookEntry objects; all object-relational mapping is handled behind
 * the scenes.  Functions are provided for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting @c %Notebook objects and
 * @c %NotebookEntry objects, as well as for searching and counting @c %NotebookEntry objects based on criteria
 * specified in a @c NotebookEntryFilter.
 *
 * Signals are provided for clients that want to respond to changes in the underlying database, and indicate when a
 * @c %Notebook or @c %NotebookEntry has been added, updated, or deleted.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *   // Here's how to add a new Notebook to the default Notebook account, and add
 *   // a NotebookEntry to the new Notebook.  Note that service objects are
 *   // potentially expensive to initialize, so you should not create them on a
 *   // per-use basis as is done below.
 *   AccountKey accountKey = AccountService().defaultAccount( Service::Notebook )
 *                                           .id();
 *   NotebookService service;
 *
 *   Notebook notebook;
 *   notebook.setName( "New Notebook" );
 * 
 *   // You should be sure to check the return code from addNotebook() for
 *   // success
 *   service.addNotebook( &notebook, accountKey );
 *
 *   NotebookEntry entry;
 *   entry.setTitle( "New NotebookEntry" );
 * 
 *   // A notebook must have been added to the notebook service before its ID
 *   // can be used below
 *   NotebookId notebookId = notebook.id();
 * 
 *   // You should be sure to check the return code from addNotebookEntry() for
 *   // success
 *   service.addNotebookEntry( &entry, notebookId );
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see Notebook, NotebookEntry
 *
 * @permissions To use the @c NotebookService class in your application, you
 * must enable the following permission in your application's bar-descriptor.xml file: @c access_pimdomain_notebooks.
 *

 * <apigrouping group="App Integration/Notebook"/>
