 *
 * @brief The @c Notebook class represents a folder-like object that contains notebook entries.
 *
 * @details Notebooks are used to organize actionable and non-actionable items called notebook entries into separate
 * folders or topics.  For example, you can create a "grocery list" notebook that contains items you need to
 * purchase, each of which can be marked as completed as it is added to your cart.  Notebooks can also contain
 * non-actionable notebook entries, such as photos taken on a trip. %Notebook entries are represented by the
 * @c NotebookEntry class.
 *
 * Some notebooks are created automatically by the system and have special meaning and behavior.  Such special
 * notebooks can be recognized by querying their @c Notebook::type() function, which will return something other than
 * @c Notebook::Generic.  A non-generic notebook cannot be deleted, and the notebook entries that it contains cannot be
 * moved to another notebook (nor can notebook entries be moved into it from another notebook).  Items in a
 * non-generic notebook are generally kept in sync with another source, such as an ActiveSync account.  See the
 * @c Notebook::Type enum for supported special notebook types.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *   // Here's how to create a Notebook with a name and custom attribute, and add
 *   // it to the default Notebook account database using the NotebookService.
 *   // Note that service objects are potentially expensive to initialize, so you
 *   // should not create them on a per-use basis as is done below.
 *   AccountKey defaultAccountKey = AccountService().defaultAccount(
 *                                                    Service::Notebook ).id();
 *   Notebook notebook;
 *   notebook.setName( "New Notebook" );
 *   notebook.setAttribute( "my_attribute", "my_attribute_value" );
 * 
 *   // You should be sure to check the return code from addNotebook() for
 *   // success
 *   NotebookService().addNotebook( &notebook, defaultAccountKey );
 * @endcode
