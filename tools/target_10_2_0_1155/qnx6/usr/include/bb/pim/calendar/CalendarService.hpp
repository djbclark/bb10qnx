/*!
 * @brief The @c CalendarService class provides access to PIM calendar data.
 *
 * @permissions @c access_pimdomain_calendars
 *
 * @details This class is an interface to the calendar service. This service
 * manages a local database and controls a set of synchronization services. Functions
 * in this class affect this database. The signals in this class are emitted
 * by changes in the calendar database, in calendar accounts, or in settings that
 * are relevant to calendar applications (for example, the current timezone).
 *
 * You can use the @c %CalendarService to create, retrieve, modify, and remove 
 * calendar events. For instances of recurring events, the class provides functions
 * for modification and exclusion. There are also functions for responding to requests
 * for meetings and to forward events to email addresses.
 *
 * Here's an example of how to perform simple operations on a calendar event and save
 * these changes to the database.
 * 
 * @code
 * CalendarService calendarService;
 *
 * // create a new event
 * CalendarEvent ev;
 * ev.setAccountId(1);
 * ev.setFolderId(1);
 * ev.setStartTime(QDateTime(2012, 7, 16, 12, 0, 0));
 * ev.setEndTime(QDateTime(2012, 7, 16, 13, 0, 0));
 * ev.setSubject("lunch");
 *
 * // save it to the database
 * calendarService.createEvent(ev);
 *
 * // modify the event, then save it to the database
 * ev.setStartTime(QDateTime(2012, 7, 16, 12, 30, 0));
 * ev.setEndTime(QDateTime(2012, 7, 16, 13, 30, 0));
 * calendarService.updateEvent(ev);
 *
 * // get any events happening from 12:30 to 13:30
 * EventSearchParameters params;
 * params.setStart(QDateTime(2012, 7, 16, 12, 30, 0));
 * params.setEnd(QDateTime(2012, 7, 16, 13, 30, 0));
 * params.setDetails(DetailLevel::Full);
 * QList<CalendarEvent> evs = calendarService.events(params);
 *
 * // remove the event from the database
 * calendarService.deleteEvent(ev);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Folders are containers for events. Each folder represents a separate calendar in the
 * Calendar application on the device. You can use the @c %CalendarService to retrieve
 * a list of folders and update the events within these folders. Here's an example of
 * how to do this:
 *
 * @code
 * QList<CalendarFolder> folders = calendarService.folders();
 * CalendarFolder firstFolder = folders.at(0);
 * firstFolder.setColor(0xFF0000);
 * calendarService.updateFolder(firstFolder);
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can also retrieve and change calendar-related system settings, such as time zone
 * and snooze time for calendar notifications. These settings are included in the
 * @c CalendarSettings class, and you can retrieve the current settings by calling
 * @c CalendarService::settings().
 * 
 * @see CalendarEvent

 * @xmlonly
 * <apigrouping group="App Integration/Calendar"/>
 * <library name="bbpim"/>
