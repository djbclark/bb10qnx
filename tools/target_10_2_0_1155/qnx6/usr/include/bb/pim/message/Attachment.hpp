 * @brief The @c Attachment class represents an attachment to a message.
 * 
 * @details This class includes information about an attachment to a @c Message object, such
 * as file path to the attachment on the file system, MIME type, and optional metadata. You
 * can retrieve the list of attachments for a @c %Message by calling
 * @c Message::attachments().
 * 
 * You can also use the @c MessageService class to retrieve message attachments. You can
 * download the attachment of a @c %Message by calling @c MessageService::downloadAttachment().
 * 
 * Each @c %Attachment object has a key, which is represented by an @c AttachmentKey,
 * and this key uniquely identifies the attachment.
