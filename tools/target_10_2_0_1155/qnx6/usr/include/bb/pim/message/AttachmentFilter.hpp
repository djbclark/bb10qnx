 * pairs.
 *
 * @details You can use this class to specify a set of criteria for attachments, and then apply
 * those criteria when you retrieve attachments using the @c MessageService. For example, you
 * can specify that you want to retrieve a list of attachments in ascending order, for a
 * particular account id and a maximum of 20 results. Then, you can call
 * @c MessageService::attachments() and provide the filter as a parameter to retrieve the
 * attachments.
