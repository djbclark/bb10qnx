 * @brief The @c AccountService class is the entry point for Account Management.
 *
 * @details It provides operations to manipulate @c Account objects and to view
 * @c Provider objects, which are used to build @c Account objects.
 *
 * Read access to the Account's domain is automatically granted when
 * requesting permission to another domain (access_pimdomain_messages or
 * access_pimdomain_contacts or access_pimdomain_calendars or
 * access_pimdomain_notebooks). Any Account calls requiring write access (to edit,
 * add or delete an account) are not granted to third party applications and will
 * result in failure.
 *
 * A signal is emitted when accounts are added, deleted, or modified.
 * Clients can respond to these signals.
