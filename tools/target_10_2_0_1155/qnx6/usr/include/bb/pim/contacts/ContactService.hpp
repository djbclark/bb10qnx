/*!
 * @brief The @c ContactService class provides CRUD (create/read/update/delete) operations on @c Contact objects.
 *
 * @permissions The application must have the @c access_pimdomain_contacts permission to access the contacts
 * database.
 *
 * @details @c %ContactService provides functions for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting @c %Contact
 * objects, as well as for searching and counting @c %Contact objects based on criteria specified using filter
 * classes, such as @c ContactListFilters and @c ContactSearchFilters.
 *
 * Each contact that's retrieved using the @c %ContactService can come from any source, and can sometimes come
 * from multiple sources if it's a merged contact. For example, contacts can come from the Contacts application,
 * BlackBerry Messenger and other social networking applications, or an inserted SIM card. There are functions
 * that you can use to filter contacts or handle contacts from their respective sources. However, the primary
 * use case for this class is to treat all contacts the same, regardless of source.
 *
 * Here's how to retrieve a list of contacts using @c contacts():
 * @code
 *      ContactListFilters filters;
 *      filters.setLimit(20);
 *      QList<Contact> contactList = ContactService().contacts(filters);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Here's how to search for a list of contacts with certain criteria using @c searchContacts():
 * @code
 *      ContactSearchFilters filters;
 *      filters.setLimit(5);
 *      filters.setSearchValue("Joe");
 *      QList<Contact> contactList = ContactService().searchContacts(filters);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Here's how to retrieve the complete details of a single contact using @c contactDetails():
 * @code
 *      Contact contact = ContactService().contactDetails(5);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see Contact

     * @c ContactListFilters. For example, you can specify that you want to return only contacts that have a specific
     * kind and sub-kind.
     *
     * You can provide an empty @c %ContactListFilters to retrieve the entire contact list. Each contact is a partial
     * contact and has very little information attached to it. These partial contacts are designed to be used to populate
     * a list view, and provide better performance in this case than returning contacts with full details. It is strongly
     * recommended to use the paging mechanism available in @c %ContactListFilters by setting an anchor ID and result
     * limit values. The more data that's retrieved from this list, the slower the response time. For reasonable
     * performance, you shouldn't exceed 200 results per page.
