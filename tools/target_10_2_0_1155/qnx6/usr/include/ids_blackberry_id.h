 * @brief Use BlackBerry ID as an identity provider for your application
 *
 * @page  BBID_Provider BlackBerry ID as an identity provider
 *
 * Using the BlackBerry ID service as an identity provider, you can enhance 
 * your app in several ways:
 * - Provide user authentication within your app, without prompting for 
 * user credentials. 
 * - Provide user authorization to access other BlackBerry apps and off-device 
 * services without prompting for user credentials.
 * - Provide access to users' personal information that is stored in the 
 * BlackBerry ID account system. User permission to access this information 
 * is required. 
 *
 * @section   user_auth_sec   User authentication without prompting for credentials
 *
 * Benefits of implementing BlackBerry ID user authentication:
 * - Eliminate the need to build your own username and password management.
 * - Automatically sign users in to your app after they sign in with their 
 * BlackBerry ID account on their devices. This makes your app easier to use.
 * - Eliminate the need for users to create and remember a username and 
 * password for your app.
 *
 * @section   off_device_service_sec   User authorization to access other BlackBerry apps and off-device services
 *
 * If your app interacts with an off-device service that requires user
 * authentication (for example, a website that requires the user to sign in
 * with a username and password), you can use BlackBerry ID APIs to perform
 * the off-device authentication/authorization using tokens, instead of
 * prompting the user for credentials. Your app and the off-device service
 * interact seamlessly.
 *
 *
 * @section pii_sec   Access personal information associated with BlackBerry ID accounts
 *
 * You can personalize the user experience of your app by incorporating your 
 * users' personal information in your app. Users must allow your app to 
 * access the information associated with their BlackBerry ID accounts before 
 * you can access it. The application must have the
 * @c read_personally_identifiable_information permission included in their bar
 * descriptor. The information that is available includes:
 * - first name
 * - last name
 * - screen name
 * - username (an email address)
 *
 * The @c ids_get_properties() function can be used to retrieve personal
 * information stored in the BlackBerry ID account system, with
 * @c BBID_PROPERTY_CORE passed as the @c type parameter
 * (see code samples below).
 *
 * @section Code_sample_sec  Sample code for using BlackBerry ID as the identity provider for your app
 *
 * In order to use BlackBerry ID as the identity provider for your app,
 * you need to use the IDS APIs defined in the ids.h library.
 *
 * Setting up your app to use BlackBerry ID as an identity provider:
 * - Step 1 - Initialize the IDS library for use by your app. You only need to 
 * do this once. 
 * - Step 2 - Register with the Identity Service to use BlackBerry ID as an 
 * identity provider.
 * - Step 3 - Add a file descriptor (FD) handler to handle communication with 
 * the IDS library.
 *
 * Once these steps have completed successfully, the app can use the IDS APIs
 * to store and retrieve data off the device, retrieve the user's personal
 * information associated with their BlackBerry ID account, and use tokens for
 * authentication and authorization.
 *
 * This code sample shows how to initialize the IDS library:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * // Make sure to include the following header files in your application
 * #include <errno.h>
 * #include <bps/bps.h>
 * #include <ids.h>
 * #include <ids_blackberry_id.h>
 *
 * // Step 1 - Initialize IDS.
 *
 * ids_result_t result = ids_initialize();
 * if( result != IDS_SUCCESS ) {
 *     displayText( "Failure to initialize. errno: %d", errno );
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * // Step 2 - Register to use BlackBerry ID as an identity provider.
 *
 * static ids_provider_t* ids_provider;
 * static int ids_fd = -1;
 *
 * result = ids_register_provider( BLACKBERRY_ID_PROVIDER, &ids_provider, &ids_fd );
 *
 * if( result != IDS_SUCCESS ) {
 *     displayText( "Failure to register. errno: %d", errno );
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * // Step 3 - Add an FD handler for the IDS library communications.
 *
 * if( bps_add_fd( ids_fd, BPS_IO_INPUT, &ids_io_handler, NULL ) != BPS_SUCCESS ) {
 *     displayText( "Failure to monitor fd. errno: %d", errno );
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * After these three steps are complete and return successfully, your
 * app is ready to use the IDS APIs to access functionality for BlackBerry ID 
 * as an identity provider. 
 *
 * Here's a code sample for how to access a user's email address, stored in 
 * the "username" field.
 *
 * @code
 * const char* properties[] = { IDS_BBID_PROP_USERNAME };
 * // Other valid values include IDS_BBID_PROP_SCREENNAME, 
 * IDS_BBID_PROP_FIRSTNAME, IDS_BBID_PROP_LASTNAME, IDS_BBID_PROP_UID
 *
 * result = ids_get_properties( ids_provider, BBID_PROPERTY_CORE, 1, properties, handle_properties, ids_call_failed, "get properties", &request_id );
 * if( result != IDS_SUCCESS ) {
 *     displayText( "Failure to getProperty. errno: %d", errno );
 *     return;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
