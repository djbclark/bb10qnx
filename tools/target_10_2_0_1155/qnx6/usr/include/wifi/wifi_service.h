 * @brief The BlackBerry Wi-Fi service library
 *
 * The Wi-Fi service APIs provide functions to determine Wi-Fi status and
 * receive events for Wi-Fi activities.
 *
 * To use the Wi-Fi service API functions, the application must have
 * the @c access_wifi_public capability. To grant an application
 * the @c access_wifi_public capability, the bar-descriptor.xml file
 * in the application's project must contain the line
 * "<permission>access_wifi_public</permission>".
 *
 * The APIs support hotspot aggregator applications that can configure
 * Wi-Fi profiles and receive aggregator specific event notifications to allow
 * connection at Wi-Fi hotspots on the user's behalf.

 * the purpose of connecting on behalf of the user.
 *
 * Applications must be registered prior to calling any other aggregator
 * APIs.
 *
 * If the BlackBerry device is not connected as a station to an access point
 * (AP), scans are triggered internally by the Wi-Fi connection manager at
 * regular intervals. When scan results are available, they will be passed
 * to applications that receive events from the Wi-Fi service library.
 *
 * The @c refresh parameter indicates if this is the first time the application
 * has tried to register.  If so, set @c refresh to @c false.  A new empty profile
 * is created and saved.  This profile is displayed to the user as disabled
 * and uneditable.  When the application determines based on scan results
 * received that there is a network it wishes to connect to, it can use one
 * of the functions below to populate the profile:
 *     - @c wifi_aggregator_set_profile_ssid()
 *     - @c wifi_aggregator_set_profile_ap_handover()
 *     - @c wifi_aggregator_set_profile_band_select()

 *     - @c wifi_aggregator_set_profile_security_psk_passphrase()
 *     - @c wifi_aggregator_set_profile_security_user_name_password()
 *
 * The @c aggregator_name parameter is used as the UI display name for the
 * aggregator profile, indicating to the user that an aggregator application
 * is registered.  If the name is a duplicate of an existing saved profile and
 * @c refresh is @c false, @c #WIFI_ERROR_AGGREGATOR_DUPLICATE is returned.
 * If @c refresh is @c true, a check for a matching @c aggregator_name profile
 * is performed.  If not found, @c #WIFI_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS
 * is returned.  Otherwise, the aggregator recovers its prior profile,
 * which is disabled at registration but can be queried or enabled
 * by the application.
 *

 * @c aggregator_name on refresh of its registration.  The Wi-Fi connection
 * manager maintains only a single Wi-Fi profile for this aggregator
 * at any one time, and the aggregator can use the above functions to
