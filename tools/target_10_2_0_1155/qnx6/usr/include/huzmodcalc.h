/** Computes integer modulo exponentiation.

Inputs to this function are integers represented in octet string.

There can be leading <tt>0</tt> octets for base and exponent.
However, leading <tt>0</tt> octet is not allowed for modulus.

The result is an element of a finite field. Thus, the result is represented
in octet string, where the value is represented in the same number of octets
as the modulus.  If the value is smaller, it will be padded with <tt>0</tt>
octets to the size of the modulus.

@param[in]  baseLen   Length of the base in bytes.
@param[in]  baseValue Value of the base as an integer
@param[in]  expoLen   Length of the exponent in bytes.
@param[in]  expoValue Value of the exponent as an integer.
@param[in]  modLen    Length of the modulus in bytes.
@param[in]  modValue  Value of the modulus as an integer.  
                      The modulus must be a prime number.
@param[out] result    The result finite field element.
@param[in]  yieldCtx  Yield context.
@param[in]  sbCtx     A global context.

@retval SB_ERR_BAD_INPUT_LEN Input parameter length is invalid.
@retval SB_ERR_NULL_INPUT    Input parameter is <tt>NULL</tt>.
@retval SB_ERR_BAD_INPUT     Input parameter value is invalid.
@retval SB_FAIL_ALLOC        Memory allocation failure.
@retval SB_FAILURE           Operation failed.
@retval SB_SUCCESS           Success.
