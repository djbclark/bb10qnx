 *
 * @brief Use BlackBerry profile as an identity provider, and provide 
 * off-device data storage.
 *
 * @page BBProfile_Provider BlackBerry profile
 * BlackBerry profile is an identity provider that allows access to
 * off-device, encrypted storage space. The storage space is bound to the 
 * BlackBerry ID user that is currently logged in. The storage is accessible 
 * remotely from all devices logged in with the same BlackBerry ID user, 
 * allowing applications installed on multiple devices access to the same 
 * information.
 *
 * @section bbprofile_supported_apis IDS API support
 * BlackBerry profile supports the following Identity Service functions. Using 
 * BlackBerry profile with other functions will result in errors.
 * - ids_create_data()
 * - ids_get_data()
 * - ids_set_data()
 * - ids_delete_data()
 * - ids_list_data()
 * - ids_register_notifier()
 *
 * @section  data_storage_sec  Off-device data storage and retrieval APIs
 * Applications can use the APIs to securely store data in, and retrieve data
 * from, the BlackBerry ecosystem. APIs are provided for storing data initially
 * (ids_create_data()), retrieving the data (ids_get_data()), updating the data
 * (ids_set_data()), and removing the data (ids_delete_data()).
 *
 * @section bbprofile_permissions Permissions
 * In order to store and retrieve data off of the device, wireless data is
 * consumed. Applications using storage from BlackBerry profile must have
 * the @c access_internet permission included in their bar descriptor file.
 *
 * @section  data_storage_caps_sec  Limits to storage capacity
 * There's a limit to the amount of off-device storage that is available to
 * each of your users. Storage limits are set according to user and app
 * vendor, and apply to all of the apps that a user might have with a
 * single vendor. For example, if you have multiple apps that require
 * off-device storage, and you have a user who makes use of three of those
 * apps, that user's storage limit applies to the total amount of storage
 * space that those three apps require. Users can have multiple storage
 * allocations, one for each app vendor.
 *
 * @internal For RIM applications that use BlackBerry profile as their
 * identity provider, there is no size restriction on how much data the app
 * can store for each user.
 *
 * @section bbprofile_caching Caching
 * In cases where the application may need data stored locally for quick or 
 * repeated access, the value can be cached securely on the device and 
 * retrieved on demand, even when not connected to the remote storage copy. 
 * The cache is synchronized with the remote copy so that the cache is always 
 * up to date while the device has appropriate data coverage.
 *
 * @section bbprofile_usage Using profile storage
 *
 * @subsection bbprofile_usage_create Create - Store a new entry
 * Call @c ids_create_data() to store new profile entries.
 *  - @c type is one of the @c ids_bbprofile_type "profile types".
 *  - @c flags are a combination of @c ids_bbprofile_create_data_flag.
 *
 * @subsection bbprofile_usage_set Set - Update an entry
 * Call @c ids_set_data() to update profile entries.
 *  - @c type is one of the @c ids_bbprofile_type "profile types".
 *  - @c flags are a combination of @c ids_bbprofile_set_data_flag.
 *
 * @subsection bbprofile_usage_get Get - Retrieve an entry
 * Call @c ids_get_data() to retrieve profile entries.
 *  - @c type is one of the @c ids_bbprofile_type "profile types".
 *  - @c flags are a combination of @c ids_bbprofile_get_data_flag.
 *
 * @subsection bbprofile_usage_delete Delete - Remove an entry
 * Call @c ids_delete_data() to remove profile entries.
 *  - @c type is one of the @c ids_bbprofile_type "profile types".
 *  - @c flags are a combination of @c ids_bbprofile_delete_data_flag.
 *
 * @subsection bbprofile_usage_list Get - List available entries
 * Call @c ids_list_data() to list profile entries.
 *  - @c type is one of the @c ids_bbprofile_type "profile types".
 *  - @c flags are a combination of @c ids_bbprofile_list_data_flag.
 *
 * @section bbprofile_notifications Notifications
 * Notifications can be registered for entries either before or after they have
 * been created. In cases where the registration is done after creation, the
 * application is notified each time the value changes so that it can
 * perform any necessary operations. If registration is done before an entry
 * is created, the application is notified upon creation of the value as
 * if it were an update. Additionally, registered applications receive a 
 * change notification when an entry is deleted.
 *
 * To register for profile entry change notifications, call 
 * @c ids_register_notifier().
 *  - @c type is one of the @c ids_bbprofile_type "profile types".
 *  - @c flags are a combination of @c ids_bbprofile_register_notifier_flag.
 *
 * Each time a registered entry changes, the registered callback function is 
 * executed and the corresponding @c ids_bbprofile_notification
 * indicates the kind of change that occurred.
